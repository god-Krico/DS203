86,"in today's class we went deep into the simple linear regression techniques by using some data in excel. in the data we have only x and y column from which we calculated other terms such as x_bar, y_bar, xbar_sq, ybar_sq, error and many more terms. we also create the scatter plot between x and y and realized that it follows linear model. we have also plot the histogram to check what is the nature of distribution of data. if it's a bell shaped curve then it is good. the scatter plot of errors values display a distinct pattern showing that model has failed to pick-up the inherent pattern in the data. next by using the data analysis tool in excel we created the summary output of an linear regression model giving many values related to regression statistics. another interesting thing is that - one that explains most of the variations in the data is 'good model'. further we learnt about some regression statistics  short forms like  1)sst = measure of total variation in the given dataset.
2)ssr => total variation explained by the regression model and 3) sse => variation not explained by the model, attributed to random errors. coefficient of determination(r^2) which is the square of the correlation coefficient 'r' between x and y. if the x is increasing and y also increases then it have (+ve) correlation. if the x is increasing and y is decreasing then it have (-ve) correlation. we conduct some 'thought' experiments, related to estimating the population mean from the sample mean: assume that from a population we can take multiple good, representative samples, let's say k samples, each of size n. let's call each sample as s_i. using each s_i, we calculate its mean and call it m_i. for samples are good, representative samples of the population, they will result in means m_i that are close to each other. if we collect all the m_i and create a frequency table and a histogram, it's shape will be bell curved.",class went deep simple linear regression techniques using excel x column calculated terms xbar ybar xbarsq ybarsq error many terms also create scatter plot x realized follows linear model also plot histogram check nature distribution bell shaped curve good scatter plot errors values display distinct pattern showing model failed pickup inherent pattern next using analysis tool excel created output linear regression model giving many values related regression statistics another interesting thing one explains variations good model regression statistics short forms like 1sst measure total variation given dataset 2ssr total variation explained regression model 3 sse variation explained model attributed random errors coefficient determinationr2 square correlation coefficient r x x increasing also increases correlation x increasing decreasing correlation conduct thought experiments related estimating population mean sample mean assume population take multiple good representative samples lets say k samples size n lets call sample si using si calculate mean call mi samples good representative samples population result means mi close collect mi create frequency table histogram shape bell curved,167,1,-22.1974,10.866087,1,0.88742244,1
482,"in today's class, we revisited the formula for a and b in the simple linear regression equation:
y = ax + b.

using a csv file in excel, we created columns for y_predicted and error. before that, we calculated the averages (xì„ and yì„), as well as xx_bar, xy_bar, and xì„â². from these values, we calculated a and b, which were used to compute y_predicted. the error was calculated as the difference between the actual y and the predicted y.

we plotted the best-fit line for our data and then visualized the errors. on a 2-d scatter plot, the errors looked fine, but when plotted as a histogram, they did not follow a gaussian (normal) distribution. this indicated that the model couldn't fully capture some trends in the data.

next, we used the regression feature in excelâ€™s data analysis toolpack to get statistical details about the regression model. we learned that the standard error measures how much the sample mean varies from the population mean. additionally, we discussed that for many samples, the distribution of sample means tends to follow a normal distribution.

lastly, we introduced three key terms:

sst (total sum of squares): measures the total variation in the data.
ssr (regression sum of squares): the variation explained by the model.
sse (error sum of squares): the variation not explained by the model.
these terms are related by the formula:
sst = ssr + sse

the râ² value, calculated as râ² = ssr / sst, represents the proportion of the total variation explained by the model.

568,"we worked on understanding regression analysis using a dataset of 100 sample points in excel. the primary focus was on calculating the regression line, represented by b (intercept) and a (slope), and using excelâ€™s data analysis toolkit to derive and analyze the regression function. we evaluated the errors by plotting a scatter plot and a histogram. interestingly, the histogram revealed a roughly uniform error distribution, emphasizing that visual interpretation of scatter plots can sometimes be misleading. 
we then discussed the characteristics of a good regression model:
the error distribution should be random.
the model should explain a significant portion of the data's variation.
finally, we explored confidence intervals, specifically the upper and lower 95% bounds, and related them to the gaussian distribution.",worked understanding regression analysis using dataset 100 sample points excel primary focus calculating regression line represented b intercept slope using excelâ€™s analysis toolkit derive analyze regression function evaluated errors plotting scatter plot histogram interestingly histogram revealed roughly uniform error distribution emphasizing visual interpretation scatter plots sometimes misleading characteristics good regression model error distribution random model explain significant portion datas variation finally explored confidence intervals specifically upper lower 95 bounds related gaussian distribution,72,1,-20.890163,9.659453,1,0.83662266,4

ei = yi - yi(hat) and plotted the error values on a scatter plot and a histogram as well. for a perfectly random data the error values should be a normal distribution (bell curve) on the histogram, which is not the case as we observed so we say that the model failed to pick up the pattern in the data.
then we used the data analysis tools for linear regression to get various information about the sample data.

then we moved on to discuss ""what is a good model?"" 
the model that explains most of the variations in the data.
sst = summation(yi - ybar)^2
sst = sse + ssr 
1 = sse/sst + ssr/sst
1 = r^2 + sse/sst
r^2 = 1 - sse/sst
r^2 : coefficient of determination
in case of simple linear regression coefficient of determination is same as the square of correlation coefficient 'r'.  
r^2 = r^2


when drawing k representative samples (si) of size n from a population, the means of these samples (mi) are expected to be similar due to their representativeness. if we plot the frequency distribution of mi, we typically get a histogram that resembles a normal distribution, as suggested by the central limit theorem. this histogram illustrates the sampling distribution of the sample mean. important characteristics of this distribution include that its mean is close to the population mean, and its standard deviation, known as the standard error (sx), is connected to the population standard deviation (sigma) and the sample size (n). these characteristics highlight the advantage of using multiple smaller samples rather than relying on a single large one, as the sampling distribution offers valuable insights into the population's traits.",class took sample 100 points found best fit line using simple linear regression ms excel calculated values b using get regression line yhat ax b plotted scatter plot x also added yhat points graph calculated error values ei yi yihat plotted error values scatter plot histogram well perfectly random error values normal distribution bell curve histogram case observed say model failed pick pattern analysis tools linear regression get information sample moved discuss good model model explains variations sst summationyi ybar2 sst sse ssr 1 ssesst ssrsst 1 r2 ssesst r2 1 ssesst r2 coefficient determination case simple linear regression coefficient determination square correlation coefficient r r2 r2 drawing k representative samples si size n population means samples mi expected similar due representativeness plot frequency distribution mi typically get histogram resembles normal distribution suggested central limit theorem histogram illustrates sampling distribution sample mean important characteristics distribution include mean close population mean standard deviation known standard error sx connected population standard deviation sigma sample size n characteristics highlight advantage using multiple smaller samples rather relying single large one sampling distribution offers valuable insights populations traits,183,1,-23.221916,10.811547,1,0.8323989,5

602,"discussed the purpose of histograms in visualizing data distribution. learned that when the output is influenced by many unknown random causes, the observed distribution may follow a normal distribution. highlighted that an error histogram not matching the norma distribution indicates the model fails to capture the trend in the error function.

uploaded a csv file into excel for analysis. performed linear regression to fit a model and plotted scatterplots:scatterplots for x vs. y and for errors were created. errors appeared random in the scatterplot but showed a uniform distribution in the histogram.

   - defined sst (sum of squares total), which is the total variation in the data.
     - sst = ssr (sum of squares regression) + sse (sum of squares error).
     - sse captures variation not explained by the model (random error).
     - ssr captures variation explained by the regression line.
   - introduced râ² (coefficient of determination)
     - râ² = ssr / sst.
     - a higher râ² indicates that more variance is captured by the model.

we also calculated the error from the data. we represented it first as a scatter plot and then as a histogram. through scatter plot, we noticed that the errors were randomly spread throughout the x-axis. but after plotting errors on histogram, our opinion changed. 
when the output depends on a large number of unknown causes (which are completely random) the distribution should be a gaussian normal distribution. but while plotting a histogram for the errors we did not obtain a gaussian distribution. this suggests that our model of linear regression fails into considering some trends in the data.

118,"today's lecture was mainly aimed at giving us a first hands on experience with data. we worked with a sample dataset on excel, where we created scatter plots and tried to implement simple linear regression. we used a tool in excel called the data analysis toolpak, which gives us a lot of information about our data and the linear regression statistics. next we discussed about histograms, which is a frequency chart showing the frequency of data distributed into various bins. 
then we studied that in an ideal case, our model should be able to harness all the predictable patterns in the data, leaving the noise or errors to be random. however, if we are able to predict the errors, that means that our model has not captured the trend between the errors. we also studied that if our outcome is dependent on a large number of unknown causes, then the distribution observed is known as a gaussian normal distribution. 
we went on to discuss that a good model is one which can explain most of the variations in our data. we defined 3 terms:
sst = measure of the total variance of the data
sse = sum of squares of the errors / noise variance
ssr = sum of squares of the total variance captured by the regression model 
then we derived a relation between these three terms to be that sst = ssr + sse. now when we divide both the sides by sst, we get a term ssr / sst on the rhs. this term is defined as the coefficient of determination, or r^2. this term tells us how close our model is in measuring the actual variance in the data. this term has a maximum value of 1, and a minimum value of 0. this term should be as close to 1 as possible, which indicates a good model. 
the term is defined as r^2, because for simple linear regression, the coefficient of determination is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient. since correlation coefficient is termed as r, the cod is termed as r^2. however this result doesn't hold true for multiple linear regression. the correlation coefficient is defined as the measure of how y changes with respect to its mean as x changes with respect to its mean. 
we moved on to define a special histogram, which captures the frequency of means of various samples of a given data. such a histogram is called the sampling distribution of the sample mean. it tells us that if we have a good representative sample, then its mean will lie very close to the mean of the population.

122,"### summary of todayâ€™s class: excel tools & simple linear regression (slr)

### **working with excel**

we spent about an hour exploring excel's functionalities for plotting, statistical calculations, and visualizing regression.

1. **statistical calculations:**
    - calculated metrics such as mean (xë‰,yë‰), standard deviation (xstd, ystd), and extra means (xy_).
    - used these values with the slr formula (derived in the previous class) to estimate the parameters of the regression line.
2. **visualization:**
    - plotted the regression line and visualized the errors (differences between actual and predicted values).

### **simple linear regression (slr) in depth:**

1. **prediction range for slr:**
    - predictions are reliable only within the range of the training data. slr does not extrapolate well beyond this range.
    - for predictions outside this range, advanced techniques like time series analysis are recommended.
2. **understanding plots:**
    - **histogram:** shows the frequency of values within bins.
    - **scatter plot:** visualizes data points on a 2d plane using two coordinates.
3. **error analysis:**
    - after fitting the regression line, we calculated the error for each data point and plotted its histogram.
    - **key insight:** if the error histogram follows a normal distribution, it suggests the model captures the overall relationship between input and output well.
    - in cases where errors show a pattern (e.g., parabolic input-output relationships), the regression line is not a good fit.
4. **excelâ€™s data analysis toolkit:**
    - provides key regression metrics like standard error, r2, adjusted r2, multiple r, confidence intervals, p-values, and t-values for the parameters.
5. **evaluating model performance:**
    - r square(coefficient of determination): represents the proportion of variance explained by the regression model relative to the total variance.
    - **why r square is called r square?** in slr, r2 equals the square of the correlation coefficient between input x and output y (denoted by r). however, this equivalence does not hold for multiple regression.
6. **what is standard error?**

457,"in today's session, we explored the process of performing linear regression using excel. we began by analyzing a scatter plot of the data, which exhibited a linear trend, prompting us to apply linear regression. using the closed form expressions derived earlier, we calculated the regression coefficients and plotted the regression line over the scatter plot of the original data. this provided a visual representation of the relationship between the variables.
we learned that predictions made using a regression model are valid only within the range of data on which the model was trained. extrapolating beyond this range can lead to inaccurate predictions. to assess the model's performance, we examined the residuals by creating a scatter plot and a histogram. the scatter plot of residuals appeared random, but upon further inspection, the histogram indicated a somewhat uniform distribution rather than the expected normal distribution. an example was provided where a regression line was force-fitted onto non-linear data, resulting in a pattern in the residuals. this demonstrated the model's failure to capture the underlying trend, emphasizing the importance of a good model that effectively explains the variation in the data. additionally, we derived the relationship sst=ssr+sse, where sst represents the total variance in the data, ssr is the component explained by the regression model, and sse represents the unexplained variance. the coefficient of determination r^2 was explained as the ratio ssr/sst, indicating the proportion of variation in the data that the model accounts for. r^2=r^2 ,here r is coefficient of correlation which indicated how y changes with respect to x.

1. introduction

this lecture focuses on practical application of linear regression concepts using excel.
we utilize the linear regression formula derived in the previous lecture to calculate the slope and intercept of the best-fit line directly within excel.
the best-fit line is then plotted on the data.
2. limitations of extrapolation

question: can we make reliable predictions for data points outside the observed range (edge points)?
answer: no. accurate extrapolation requires sufficient data points within the target region to ensure the linear regression model remains valid.
3. analyzing prediction errors

we plot the error (difference between predicted and actual values) for each data point.
observation: the errors appear random.
question: what is the expected distribution of these random errors?
4. distribution of random errors

central limit theorem: when an outcome is influenced by numerous independent random factors, the distribution of the observed results tends to follow a gaussian (normal) distribution.
we create a histogram of the prediction errors to visually examine their distribution.
5. automated linear regression with excel

we utilize the ""data analysis"" tool in excel to perform linear regression automatically.
this provides a wealth of statistical output.
6. evaluating model fit

key concept: a good model effectively explains the maximum variation in the data.
decomposition of variance:
sst (total sum of squares): total variation in the dependent variable (y).
ssr (regression sum of squares): variation in y explained by the regression model.
sse (error sum of squares): variation in y not explained by the model, attributed to random error.
coefficient of determination (r-squared):
r-squared = ssr / sst
r-squared quantifies the proportion of total variation explained by the regression model.
in simple linear regression, r-squared is also equal to the square of the correlation coefficient (r) between the independent (x) and dependent (y) variables.",handson linear regression analysis excel 1 introduction focuses practical application linear regression concepts using excel utilize linear regression formula derived previous calculate slope intercept bestfit line directly within excel bestfit line plotted 2 limitations extrapolation question make reliable predictions points outside observed range edge points answer accurate extrapolation requires sufficient points within target region ensure linear regression model remains valid 3 analyzing prediction errors plot error difference predicted actual values point observation errors appear random question expected distribution random errors 4 distribution random errors central limit theorem outcome influenced numerous independent random factors distribution observed results tends follow gaussian normal distribution create histogram prediction errors visually examine distribution 5 automated linear regression excel utilize analysis tool excel perform linear regression automatically provides wealth statistical output 6 evaluating model fit key concept good model effectively explains maximum variation decomposition variance sst total sum squares total variation dependent variable ssr regression sum squares variation explained regression model sse error sum squares variation explained model attributed random error coefficient determination rsquared rsquared ssr sst rsquared quantifies proportion total variation explained regression model simple linear regression rsquared also equal square correlation coefficient r independent x dependent variables,193,1,-21.209997,9.19992,1,0.7745179,23

1) manually entering the formulas for calculating the regression coefficients:- here we first calculated all the required entities to calculate the regression coefficients that are xbar, ybar, xy, xybar, xsqbar etc. after this using the derived formula we calculate the regression coefficients beta0 and beta1. after that we created a scatter plot of the data as well as the predicted values using the regression coefficients.

2) using data analysis tool - just select the data and you will get a complete analysis of the data along with the regression coefficients there confidence intervals, r2 score etc.

after this we learnt how to decide whether a model is a ""good model"" or not. a good model is a model that is able to explain the variation in the data. for this we calculate metrics like r2 (c.o.d), co-relation and co-relation coefficient. we have other metrics also like mae, mse etc. we train the model on a sample of the population so we want to create a general model which can generalize things well and do prediction for population. we create confidence intervals. and the class ended with the discussion on the central limit theorem.

we analyzed error by plotting and scatter plot, later proving what we see is not always true by plotting a histogram and finding a rough uniform distribution of error. also a new statement came to me that, when the outcome is dependent on large number of uncommon causes which are random, the distribution id a normal gaussian.
we found that error was not so random in our case and concluded that there are some things/ parameters which the regression model is unable to calculate. 
next we defined what is a good model?
[1] we can determine it by the random distribution of error function and
[2] how much variation can the model explain for the provided data

while performing regression on a certain sample of data, the model is best suited for the points within the sample limit. we can predict the values beyond the sample, but accuracy would not be satisfactory enough. for such cases, we need to use other tools like time series analysis and merely slr is not enough. we made scatter plots for the errors and analyzed the distribution of these errors. through the scatter plot it seemed that the errors were randomly oriented, but after plotting the histogram for the errors, we noticed that there was some kind of uniformity in the distribution of the errors. the histogram plot gives good insights about the distribution of data (errors). if the errors are perfectly random, then the histogram would have more or less a gaussian normal distribution. we also want the errors to be random, which means the trend in the data is well picked by our model. if the error distribution is not completely random, it means our model missed to capture some trend in the data, which is shown up in the errors. we also discussed upon the coefficient of determination, represented by r^2. it is represented so because it is exactly equal to the square of the correlation coefficient between x and y, r. r^2 is the ratio of sum of squares of variation that is captured by our model to that of the variation that is actually present in the data. so, we want our model to capture maximum variation in the data. hence, we want r^2 to be as close to 1 as possible. the total variance in the data is equal to the sum of variance captured by the model and the squares of errors.

error metrics

error metrics measure the accuracy of the regression modelâ€™s predictions.
	1.	sum of squares error (sse):

sse = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2

	â€¢	measures total squared error between actual ( y_i ) and predicted ( \hat{y}_i ) values.
	â€¢	lower values indicate a better fit.
	2.	mean squared error (mse):

mse = \frac{sse}{n}

	â€¢	average squared error across all data points.
	â€¢	penalizes larger errors more due to squaring.
	3.	root mean squared error (rmse):

rmse = \sqrt{mse}

	â€¢	provides an error metric in the same units as the dependent variable ( y ).
	â€¢	useful for comparing models.
	4.	mean absolute error (mae):

histogram: a histogram is simply a frequency chart that shows how often different values appear in a dataset.

a good model: a good model is one that explains most of the variation in the data.

ssr: sum of squares of regression, or the total variation explained by the regression line.

râ² is the coefficient of determination, which measures how well the regression model explains the variation in the data.

point estimates give a single value for a population parameter but may not be accurate due to variation in samples. interval estimates provide a range where the true population value is likely to be, with a certain level of confidence. for example, we can say we are 95% confident that our b0 or b1 lies within this interval.

then we started discussing simple linear regression. in this model, we fit the data using a line (a simple linear equation with just one independent variable).
we can always use a point to represent any data, but this choice is very naive. so we instead use a simple equation like: y=ax+b where a and b are the estimates of population parameters and x is the independent variable. the y intercept, b here represents the sum total of the effects of all â€˜unknownâ€™ independent variables, which are not considered in the equation. so, as we include more and more independent variables, the value of b would start decreasing. also, depending upon the chosen sample, we can have various values of a and b. so, every sample will have a unique value for a and b. these values- a and b are known as the point estimates of the actual parameters. we can say with 100% confidence that the values of these point estimates do not coincide with the actual parameter values. so, in order to establish a certain level of certainty about the parameter values, we convert the point estimates to interval estimates, thereby giving a confidence interval, within which the population parameters would lie, with a given level of certainty. as the length of confidence interval increases, we become more and more confident that the estimated values resemble the parameter values. now, since different samples would give us different values of the estimates, we need to determine the values, which minimize the error. error for an observation is defined as the difference between the actual value and that obtained by estimating the data set with a line. so, to find the values of a and b, we need to minimize the sum of squares of individual errors. we do this by partially differentiating the expression with respect to a and b separately and by solving the two equations for two unknowns, we get the values of a and b in terms of the means and the mean of squares of the data set values. after getting the values of a and b, we put them in the equation to obtain the best model for the given data set. we consider the squares while minimizing errors instead of simply minimizing their sum as- it magnifies the errors, also it prevents cancellation of the errors, which can result when one point is above the line and other is below. since, we are getting the exact values of a and b, these are known as â€˜closed-form solutionsâ€™.
we do observe that the means of x and y (all observed values) satisfy the equation of the regression line. so, the predicted/ approximated line for the data values, pass through their mean.

517,"in today's lecture, we started the discussion with population vs sample that the sample must be good and representative of the entire population. we use the sample to predict/estimate various attributes of the population.

attributes of population:
1. count (frequency)
2. mode
3. mean
4. median
5. standard deviation
6. variance

operations:
1. count
2. add
3. subtract
4. multiply
5. divide

if these attributes are calculated from the population they are known as parameters and if they are calculated from a sample they are known as statistic.
we want to estimate the parameters based on the statistics.

slr -> simple linear regression:
(it has only one predictor) 

we find the best fit line for the given data in the slr model.
y = b0 + b1x
where, y -> dependent variable, response variable, label
             x -> independent variable, feature, predictor

even a point can be considered as a model - although a very naive model.

here, b0 is called as bias as it accounts for all the other features which we didn't account for in the model.
b0 and b1 are the estimates of the population parameters (i.e. statistics).
since these are calculated from the sample their confidence is very low. so, we need to find a confidence interval containing these estimates in which we can confidently say that the real population parameters would lie in.
on increasing the interval width, the confidence also increases.

we have y(hat) = ax+b, for each data value we define error ei = yi - yi(hat).
now to get the best fit line we need to minimize the errors.
for that taking the sum of all the individual errors won't work as the positive and negative errors might get cancelled leading to zero net error even if the individual error values are large.
to address this issue we can minimize the sum of either |ei| or (ei)^2. 
we prefer the sum of (ei)^2 as:
1. it magnifies the error for a better fit.
2. it doesn't differentiate between different directions.

summation(ei)^2 = summation(yi - yi(hat))^2 
                               = summation (yi - ax -b)^2
here, we can minimize the error by making the derivative of error zero with respect to both a and b to get their values.
we have 'closed form' solution to calculate the values of a and b.
we can also observe from the equations that the point with average values of features as x-coordinate and average values of labels as y-coordinate lies on the best fit line.

b0 and b1 are 'point estimates' so we need to arrive at the possible interval within which these values lie such that there is a very high chance that b0p and b1p (i.e. the population parameters) will lie within these intervals respectively.

323,"in todayâ€™s class we learnt about simple linear regression and how we estimate the coefficients,  m and  c, using sample data. these coefficients define the regression line. we learnt that these values are only point estimates of the population parameters, which means they wonâ€™t exactly match the true population values but should be close. the confidence for that exact point will be 0%. however we can obtain an interval with a given confidence. it is called estimation interval or confidence interval. if we increase the size of interval, the confidence will increase too. example- for confidence of 100% the interval needs to be infinity like entire domain.
for sample we get those coefficient and we call it statistic. for population it is called parameter. our main aim is to obtain parameter based on statistic. for the regression line we also define an error term which can be calculated in multiple ways. we can either take absolute difference of all points from the line and sum it up. other way we could take the square of distances of point from line and sum it up. in this way the error is calculated for each point and we aim to minimize it to get those linear regression coefficients.",todayâ€™s class simple linear regression estimate coefficients c using sample coefficients define regression line values point estimates population parameters means wonâ€™t exactly match true population values close confidence exact point 0 however obtain interval given confidence called estimation interval confidence interval increase size interval confidence increase confidence 100 interval needs infinity like entire domain sample get coefficient call statistic population called parameter main aim obtain parameter based statistic regression line also define error term calculated multiple ways either take absolute difference points line sum way could take square distances point line sum way error calculated point aim minimize get linear regression coefficients,102,2,-23.767256,-7.259774,2,0.79998624,14

456,"population v/s sample: the quality of a sample is measured by how well it represents the population. once we have a sample, we need to predict the population from the sample.

there are various attributes like mean, median, mode and various operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.  

depending on the level of measurement ,we can or cannot calculate certain attributes or perform certain operations.

any variable measured for the sample is deemed as a statistic whereas any variable measured for the population is deemed as a parameter.

simple linear regression: fitting a best fit line through the set of data to try to model it accurately.

the type of model to fit is highly dependent on how the data is spread. for a circular distribution, a point may also seem like a valid model but it is a little naive and inaccurate to do so.

a simple linear regression has one dependent and one independent variable where y=b0+b1*(x).the coefficients b0 and b1 are calculated so that the resulting line is best fitted to the given data. we try to find a confidence interval around b0 and b1 so that we can confidently say that a large fraction(most of the data) lies within that interval.the error is the difference between the predicted y value and the ctual y value and the sum of squares of errors is minimized in what is known as the least squares fitting method.

280,"today's lecture started off with a discussion about the difference between population and sample. sample is a small subset representing the entire population because gathering data for the entire population can be very difficult. so the sample should be a good representative of the population, and we should be able to predict the population's behaviour from the sample. there are various statistical attributes of data which can be calculated. some of them are frequency, mean, median, mode, std. deviation, variance, etc. if these attributes are calculated for the sample, they are called as statistics, whereas if they are estimated for the population, they are called the parameters. so our main focus with data science and ml is to estimate the parameters from the statistics. 
then we moved on to simple linear regression, where we have only one influencing or independent variable steering our predictions. our model is basically of the form y = ax + b, where x is the independent variable (predictor, feature), y is the dependent variable (response variable, label) and b is the bias term. the bias term accounts for all the unknown variables influencing our predictions. so as and when we bring more and more influencing variables into our model, the bias term keeps on reducing. 
one special thing that sir mentioned today was that a model can be as simple as a point. even a point predictor can be a model, however it may not be relevant for any practical usage and may not represent our data well. 
so a and b are the statistics of the population parameters. we also defined a confidence interval, which is the interval of values within which the parameters lie. the larger the confidence interval, the more confident we can be of the parameter value lying in that interval. then we also talked about minimising the error between our predictions and the actual data value at a given point. we said that the error can be formulated in various ways, but the most optimum way is to consider the sum of the squared errors, as that is something which is least influenced by the sign and the direction of fluctuation, and hence should be the best choice for minimisation. upon doing minimisation, we calculated the values of the statistics a and b. however these were closed form solution which were basically point estimates of the parameters. these estimates might not give us any confidence about the actual parameter values, hence we also need to find a possible interval within which the value of the parameters can exist with a very high probability.",started difference population sample sample small subset representing entire population gathering entire population difficult sample good representative population able predict populations behaviour sample statistical attributes calculated frequency mean median mode std deviation variance etc attributes calculated sample called statistics whereas estimated population called parameters main focus science ml estimate parameters statistics moved simple linear regression one influencing independent variable steering predictions model basically form ax b x independent variable predictor feature dependent variable response variable label b bias term bias term accounts unknown variables influencing predictions bring influencing variables model bias term keeps reducing one special thing sir mentioned model simple point even point predictor model however may relevant practical usage may represent well b statistics population parameters also defined confidence interval interval values within parameters lie larger confidence interval confident parameter value lying interval also talked minimising error predictions actual value given point said error formulated ways optimum way consider sum squared errors something least influenced sign direction fluctuation hence best choice minimisation upon minimisation calculated values statistics b however closed form solution basically point estimates parameters estimates might give us confidence actual parameter values hence also need find possible interval within value parameters exist high probability,198,2,-26.533272,-9.944964,2,0.7758492,18
20," a sample is just a smaller group taken from a larger population. any calculations we make from a sample, like averages, variances, or standard deviations, are called statistics, while the same calculations done on the entire population are known as parameters. the goal is often to estimate these population parameters using statistics from a sample.
now, in the case of simple linear regression, weâ€™re trying to find a straight line that best fits our data so we can predict one thing based on another. the equation of this line is written as: 
y = î²â‚€ +  î²â‚x 
where:
y is the predicted value,
x is the input value, and
î²â‚€ and î²â‚ are the parameters of the line.
these parameters, î²â‚€ and î²â‚, represent the intercept and the slope of the line, and they're estimates of the population parameters. to get the best estimates for these, we want to minimize the errorsâ€”basically, the difference between the actual data points and the line we're drawing.
we do this by minimizing the sum of squared errors which are just the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. it's a way to avoid problems that would arise from just using raw differences (like positive and negative errors canceling each other out). minimizing these squared differences gives us the best-fit line.
to find the actual values of î²â‚€ and î²â‚, we use a method called partial differentiation to minimize the errors. the formulas that come out of this are:
î²â‚€ = mean(y) - î²â‚ * mean(x)
î²â‚ = (mean(xy) - mean(x) * mean(y)) / (mean(xâ²) - mean(x)â²)
these give us the estimated values of the slope and intercept, which help us understand the relationship between the variables in our data. by using these estimates, we can get a good approximation of the population parameters and make predictions from our model.",sample smaller group taken larger population calculations make sample like averages variances standard deviations called statistics calculations done entire population known parameters goal often estimate population parameters using statistics sample case simple linear regression weâ€™re trying find straight line best fits predict one thing based another equation line written î²â‚€ î²â‚x predicted value x input value î²â‚€ î²â‚ parameters line parameters î²â‚€ î²â‚ represent intercept slope line theyre estimates population parameters get best estimates want minimize errorsâ€”basically difference actual points line drawing minimizing sum squared errors squared differences predicted actual values way avoid problems would arise using raw differences like positive negative errors canceling minimizing squared differences gives us bestfit line find actual values î²â‚€ î²â‚ use method called partial differentiation minimize errors formulas come î²â‚€ meany î²â‚ meanx î²â‚ meanxy meanx meany meanxâ² meanxâ² give us estimated values slope intercept help us understand relationship variables using estimates get good approximation population parameters make predictions model,156,2,-22.996738,-9.978228,2,0.77489877,19

simple linear regression has only one predictor.

y is the response variable/dependent variable/label
x is the predictor variable/independent variable/feature

on a scatter plot in which it looked like the points were scattered on the surface of a circular disc. then he pointed out a few things, which are:
1.	simple linear regression is not required in such cases.
2.	it would not be the best possible method in such cases.
3.	but if someone wants to apply it, then it can be applied.
4.	in such a case a point is a better approximation than a line, this can be understood by taking any value of the feature (x) and then by looking at the difference in its actual value at that x and the predicted value.
5.	each point can be considered as a model â€“ although a very naã¯ve one.

bias - value of the y â€“ intercept in the equation obtained by simple linear regression.

as the size of the sample which we are using to estimate the population parameters increases the estimates become better.

estimation interval or confidence interval, finding î²0 and î²1 was just the start of machine learning. we need to take into account the error that would be there in our estimation. we have no basis to say that î²0 = î²0p.

confidence interval which is that with a% probability we can say that the parameter value will lie in an interval, that interval is known as confidence interval. typically, confidence intervals are of 90% or 95% and sometimes even 99%. 100% confidence interval is the interval from -infinity to +infinity.

308,"in today's lecture, we built on our previous discussion about the distinction between a population and a sample. additionally, we delved deeper into simple linear regression (slr), exploring its concepts and applications. below is a detailed summary of the topics covered.

1. sample vs population
    1. sample is a part of the population which we use to predict the parameters of population.
    2. it should be a good representation of the population otherwise parameter estimates would be way off the mark.
    
    then we defined some formal terms for population and sample.
    
    properties of samples are called â€œstatisticsâ€
    
    properties of samples are called â€œparametersâ€
    
    we use statistics to estimate parameters.
    
2. then we delved into what operations can be applied on data captured via different scales of measurement
    1. nominal / ordinal: you can perform operations like counting, addition, subtraction
    2. interval / ratio: you can perform operations like counting, addition, subtraction, mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance etc.
3. simple linear regression (slr)
    1. when we have one independent variable(x) and one dependent variable(y)
    2. independent variable(x): feature, predictor
    3. dependent variable(y): response variable, label
    4. we had a dataset of 100 points, plotted a scatter plot and observed that y is linearly dependent on x and decided to use slr (a line of form: a + bx) to solve the problem.
    5. reason for this offset â€˜aâ€™ is the unaccounted features which affects the target variable. we can also say that magnitude of bias = sum of all unaccounted feature in the system
    6. we discussed how parameter estimates vary depending on sample variability. to address this, we need to use a sample set that accurately represents the population, or our parameter estimates will be inaccurate.
    7. the parameter estimates (a, b) for sure will not be same as true population parameter. thus we use the concept of confidence interval where we find the probability of true population parameter in some range around the parameter estimates.
    8. finally, we explored how to find the best-fit straight line by examining various loss functions including manhattan distance, euclidean distance, and modular distance. we discussed where each technique is most applicable. for line fitting, we used euclidean distance and reviewed the derivation for estimating parameters (a, b). in the case of simple linear regression, we discovered a closed-form solution for these parameters.",built previous distinction population sample additionally delved deeper simple linear regression slr exploring concepts applications detailed topics covered 1 sample vs population 1 sample part population use predict parameters population 2 good representation population otherwise parameter estimates would way mark defined formal terms population sample properties samples called â€œstatisticsâ€ properties samples called â€œparametersâ€ use statistics estimate parameters 2 delved operations applied captured via different scales measurement 1 nominal ordinal perform operations like counting addition subtraction 2 interval ratio perform operations like counting addition subtraction mean median mode standard deviation variance etc 3 simple linear regression slr 1 one independent variablex one dependent variabley 2 independent variablex feature predictor 3 dependent variabley response variable label 4 dataset 100 points plotted scatter plot observed linearly dependent x decided use slr line form bx solve problem 5 reason offset â€˜aâ€™ unaccounted features affects target variable also say magnitude bias sum unaccounted feature system 6 parameter estimates vary depending sample variability address need use sample set accurately represents population parameter estimates inaccurate 7 parameter estimates b sure true population parameter thus use concept confidence interval find probability true population parameter range around parameter estimates 8 finally explored find bestfit straight line examining loss functions including manhattan distance euclidean distance modular distance technique applicable line fitting euclidean distance reviewed derivation estimating parameters b case simple linear regression discovered closedform solution parameters,226,2,-27.83913,-10.300328,2,0.756446,26
291,"simple linear regression is a statistical method used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on one independent variable by fitting a straight line. if there are more than one variable it is called multiple linear regression. sample data represents a subset of the population used for analysis, while population data includes the entire dataset of interest. we use our sample to estimates the parameters of the population by beta 0 and beta 1. different sample can result in different model with different accuracy .the best-fit line minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values. it provides insights into the relationship between variables, helping in prediction and trend analysis.

503,"in today's lecture we discussed about sample and population differences, we discussed about statistics i.e. when the data is calculated for the sample and it is called parameter when it is calculated for the population. we can find the parameters (estimation) using linear regression to find the best fit line for the data. the equation of this best fit (regression) line is y = b0 + b1x, where b0,b1 are parameters. we also discussed on how to find the confidence interval for these parameter's estimates and using the sum of squares method to minimize the error. in this squares method we use sum of squares of (errors) distances as the errors can be +ve or -ve so directly the sum won't give minimum error as sum can be minimsed from -ve values of errors which may be of greater absolute values.
so now we will minimize this summation ei ^2    by partially differentiating w.r.t. b0 and b1. this will help us to determine the estimates of the parameters for the data, where ei = error = (yi- b0 + b1x). hence we get the final estimated values of these parameters as:
b0 = [mean(y)- b1 * mean(x)    and   b1 = mean(x*y) - mean(x)*mean(y)] / [mean(x^2)- (mean(x))^2]

3,"population and sample were further discussed upon. sample is a good and representative part of the population. sample is used to predict/estimate the population. attributes and operations such as count, mode , median, mean, std. deviation , variance , add, multiply, divide and subtract. different level of measurement were classified on the basis of these attributes and operations. population has parameter(s) while sample has statistic. we estimate parameters on the basis of these statistic. linear data model was discussed upon from the sales vs advt. expenditure . any model can be fitted upon any set of data but it might not be the best fit. even a point can be considered a model although a naive model. as sample size increases the estimation of parameters gets better and better. based on th sample a slr can be fit with the equation y=î²o+î²1 , where î²o is the bias in the data , as the sample size gets closer and closer to the population this bias reduces. bias represents the sum of the effect of all the unknown(unaccounted for) variables. î²o and î²1 are estimates of the population parameters. we can determine confidence intervals around the estimated parameters , the size of the confidence interval depends upon the level of confidence. as the level of confidence increases the confidence interval gets wider and wider. to find the best fit line we equate the sum of squares of errors of data points from the line to 0. we use ei^2 because it does not depend upon the direction gives the euclidean distance rather than the manhattan distance we get in the case of |ei| . upon partial differentiation of the sum of squares of error we get the values of a and b of the equation y=ax + b.

6,"the lecture explained how we use samples to understand populations. a sample is a small group taken from a population that should represent it well. this lets us study the sample to estimate the population's parameters. these estimates, calculated from the sample, are called statistics.
we then discussed regression. a good model takes the data from the sample to find a slope and an intercept of a regression line. these are our best estimates of the true values for the population. however, point estimates aren't very accurate. they're good, but they're not great. so to make our estimation more reliable, we form an interval estimate that allows us to say something like, ""we are 95% confident that the true value lies in this range.""
points estimates are different for different samples and better if sample becomes larger.
we then considered how to determine the best-fit line. among the methods available, such as minimizing the sum of errors or mod of errors , these were not the best approaches. instead, we opted to minimize the sum of squared errors, which yields better results because it reduces the effect of larger errors by magnifying them.
finally, we found a direct formula to compute the slope and intercept. it is known as closed form since we do not require iteration.",explained use samples understand populations sample small group taken population represent well lets us study sample estimate populations parameters estimates calculated sample called statistics regression good model takes sample find slope intercept regression line best estimates true values population however point estimates arent accurate theyre good theyre great make estimation reliable form interval estimate allows us say something like 95 confident true value lies range points estimates different different samples sample becomes larger considered determine bestfit line among methods available minimizing sum errors mod errors best approaches instead opted minimize sum squared errors yields results reduces effect larger errors magnifying finally found direct formula compute slope intercept known closed form since require iteration,113,2,-23.948523,-6.3143945,2,0.744093,30

-samples should be representative
-a narrow definition of the population may allow us to sample the whole population
-for every sample we can find the following three for the data:
   1. level of measurement- nominal/ordinal/interval/ratio

   3. operations- count, add, subtract, multiply...
-""we estimate a parameter for a population and we calculate a statistic for a sample.""
-finally, ""we wish to estimate the parameters from the calculated statistics.""
-from the scatter plot of a given data we decide if linear model is a good fit
-for the same data we might even use a single point as the model, but that is a naive model

-bias occurs due to the other variables' effect on the dependent variable

400,"learnt about population and sample.if not impossible then it will be very expensive to work with the data of entire population so we always study some parts of the population i.e. sample.our main objective is to estimate different parameters of the population based on the statistics that we obtained from our sample. there are various attributes associated to a data.for example if we have the data of marbles in the box then we can calculate frequency of particular colour balls,mean,median,mode,standard deviation,variance and also can perform certain operations like addition, subtraction,etc.we use different models like line,point depending on the data we have.point is considered a very naive model.
then took an example of simple linear regression(assuming only one predictor i.e. advertisement expenditure) to predict sales.for that the equation is y=b_0+b_1x where b_0 and b_1 of sample are point estimates of population parameters i e. we can claim with 0% confidence that b_0 and b_1 for population will be these values only.our aim is to find a confidence interval so that with good enough confidence we can claim that the values of b_0 and b_1 for the population will lie in that interval.the ""b_0"" term is called the 'bias' and it accounts for other factors that might affect sales so our natural intuition is that as we increase the number of predictor variables bias will decrease and if at all we can include all the predictor variables then bias will be zero.
lastly,we found out how to actually calculate this b_0 and b_1 of a given sample.we try to minimize the sum of the square of the errors where error is the distance between actual value and the value that we get from the line.one interesting thing that we got after the derivation was that mean of the predictor values and response values lie on the best fit line.",population sampleif impossible expensive work entire population always study parts population ie sampleour main objective estimate different parameters population based statistics obtained sample attributes associated datafor marbles box calculate frequency particular colour ballsmeanmedianmodestandard deviationvariance also perform certain operations like addition subtractionetcwe use different models like linepoint depending havepoint considered naive model took simple linear regressionassuming one predictor ie advertisement expenditure predict salesfor equation yb0b1x b0 b1 sample point estimates population parameters e claim 0 confidence b0 b1 population values onlyour aim find confidence interval good enough confidence claim values b0 b1 population lie intervalthe b0 term called bias accounts factors might affect sales natural intuition increase number predictor variables bias decrease include predictor variables bias zero lastlywe found actually calculate b0 b1 given samplewe try minimize sum square errors error distance actual value value get lineone interesting thing got derivation mean predictor values response values lie best fit line,149,2,-29.167852,-8.027053,2,0.7434245,32

these attributes and operators provide estimates of population qualities. however, we must also account for the inherent error in these estimates.
â€¢	population: provides parameters.
â€¢	sample: provides statistics.
linear regression
suppose we collect a substantial dataset and model it using the equation:
â€¢	y = b0 + b1x
â€¢	y: dependent variable, response variable, or label.
â€¢	x: independent variable, feature, or predictor.
this linear model, while simplistic, provides a foundational understanding.
when performing linear regression on multiple samples (s1, s2) from the same population, we obtain different models. consequently, the calculated values for b0 and b1 are estimates or statistics of the true population parameters (b0p and b1p).
confidence intervals
the true population parameters (b0p and b1p) are typically unknown. therefore, we estimate their range using confidence intervals.
â€¢	b0p lies within the interval: b0 - d to b0 + d
â€¢	a point interval has 0% confidence, while an infinite interval has 100% confidence.
model fit and error minimization
to determine the best-fit line, we compare actual y values (yi) with the model's predicted values (yi-hat). the difference (error, ei) is calculated.
â€¢	error minimization: 
o	manhattan error: summation of |ei|
o	euclidean error: summation of ei^2
minimizing euclidean error often leads to a closed-form solution for b0 and b1, as in linear regression. however, this is not always the case.
point estimates and confidence intervals
ultimately, b0 and b1 are point estimates. to enhance our understanding, we construct confidence intervals (e.g., 95%, 90%, 99%) within which the true population parameters (b0p and b1p) are likely to reside.

542,"sir started with the topic â€œpopulation vs. sampleâ€. sample should be good and representative. probably the two should mean the same thing. using the sample we predict/estimate certain characteristics of the population. 
analysing the entire population to understand its behaviour/characteristics is not feasible both â€“ time wise and money wise. so, we make use of (representative) samples.
attributes
attributes associated with samples as well as population are:
1.	count (frequency)
2.	mode
3.	mean
4.	standard deviation
5.	variance, and many others
operations
operations associated with samples as well as population are:
1.	count
2.	add
3.	subtract
4.	multiply
5.	divide and many others
then sir asked us to make a table which contains attributes and operations associated with each of the four levels of measurement.

using a sample, we can estimate the mean of the population.
attributes associated with the population are known as parameters while those associated with the sample as statistics.
we want to estimate the parameters based on the statistics.
sir then showed us a scatter plot (between sales and advertising expenditure) and presented a case of simple linear regression. simple linear regression has only one predictor.
y is the response variable/dependent variable/label
x is the predictor variable/independent variable/feature
sir was then showing us a scatter plot in which it looked like the points were scattered on the surface of a circular disc. then he pointed out a few things, which are:
1.	simple linear regression is not required in such cases.
2.	it would not be the best possible method in such cases.
3.	but if someone wants to apply it, then it can be applied.
4.	in such a case a point is a better approximation than a line, this can be understood by taking any value of the feature (x) and then by looking at the difference in its actual value at that x and the predicted value.
5.	each point can be considered as a model â€“ although a very naã¯ve one.

now sir started talking about bias which is the value of the y â€“ intercept in the equation obtained by simple linear regression. he said bias is the net some of all un-accounted variables. so, if we develop such a model in which we have taken into account all the variables which affect the dependent variable (y) then we would obtain an equation which would pass through the origin. 

then he said that as the size of the sample which we are using to estimate the population parameters increases the estimates become better. think of this by thinking that if the entire population is the sample, then the estimates would be exactly equal to the parameters, if we decrease the size of this sample by some amount then the new estimates would be lesser good estimates than they were previously. now keeping on decreasing the size of the sample and think about the estimatesâ€™ reliability (it decreases). prediction error would increase.

then sir talked about estimation interval or confidence interval. he said that finding î²0 and î²1 was just the start of machine learning. we need to take into account the error that would be there in our estimation. we have no basis to say that î²0 = î²0p.
then he gave the definition of confidence interval which is that with a% probability we can say that the parameter value will lie in an interval, that interval is known as confidence interval. typically, confidence intervals are of 90% or 95% and sometimes even 99%. 100% confidence interval is the interval from -infinity to +infinity.
then sir talked about how to define the best fit line. now there were four options:
1.	minimize sum of all ei
2.	minimize the sum of squares of all ei.
3.	minimize the sum of perpendicular distance between all pairs of {(xi,,yi) and (xi,yi-bar)}.
4.	minimize the sum of absolute value of all ei.
here ei = yi â€“ (yi-bar)    
(1) is rejected (4) is rejected because we donâ€™t want our solutions to be biased towards any direction so we choose (2).
a professor sir/maâ€™am from iit kanpur has done (3).
now refer sirâ€™s linear regression derivation and from there we see that the equation of the line that is obtained after (2) is such that the point made up of the mean of the labels and features lies on that line.

319,"the notes focus on estimating the population mean using a single sample and the principles of linear and multiple linear regression. to estimate the population mean, the first step is to calculate the sample mean and assume it is close to the true population mean. the sampling distribution of the mean is used, which follows a normal distribution for large samples. the standard error, which measures the variability of the sample mean, is calculated by dividing the sample standard deviation by the square root of the sample size. confidence intervals are then used to estimate the range within which the population mean is likely to lie. for smaller sample sizes, the t-distribution is used instead of the normal distribution to account for additional uncertainty.

the notes also delve into linear regression, which models the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable. the regression equation is represented as ( y = î²_0 + î²_1x ), where ( î²_0 ) is the intercept and ( î²_1) is the slope. to determine if the regression model is valid, the significance of ( î²_1) is checked. if the confidence interval for ( î²_1 ) includes zero, the regression is not statistically significant. a low p-value, typically less than 0.05, suggests that ( î²_1 ) is significantly different from zero, validating the regression model.

in multiple linear regression, the model expands to include multiple independent variables. the equation is ( y = î²_0 + î²_1x_1 + î²_2x_2 + ... + î²_kx_k ). anova, or analysis of variance, is used to assess the significance of the model by comparing the variability explained by the regression to the variability due to error. this is done using the f-statistic, which is the ratio of the mean square regression to the mean square error. a significant f-statistic indicates that the model is a good fit for the data.",notes focus estimating population mean using single sample principles linear multiple linear regression estimate population mean first step calculate sample mean assume close true population mean sampling distribution mean follows normal distribution large samples standard error measures variability sample mean calculated dividing sample standard deviation square root sample size confidence intervals estimate range within population mean likely lie smaller sample sizes tdistribution instead normal distribution account additional uncertainty notes also delve linear regression models relationship dependent variable independent variable regression equation represented î²0 î²1x î²0 intercept î²1 slope determine regression model valid significance î²1 checked confidence interval î²1 includes zero regression statistically significant low pvalue typically less 005 suggests î²1 significantly different zero validating regression model multiple linear regression model expands include multiple independent variables equation î²0 î²1x1 î²2x2 î²kxk anova analysis variance assess significance model comparing variability explained regression variability due error done using fstatistic ratio mean square regression mean square error significant fstatistic indicates model good fit,159,3,-22.550272,-2.5605912,3,0.88008666,1

in regression, the f-score evaluates if the modelâ€™s overall relationship is significant (comparing explained vs. unexplained variance). anova tables summarize this with metrics like degrees of freedom (df) and significance f (p-value for the model). standard error measures their precision, and p-values test if they meaningfully impact the outcome. these tools together assess the modelâ€™s validity and variable importance.",focused statistical concepts linear regression modelâ€™s errors residuals predictable eg follow pattern suggests model failed capture underlying trends leading biased predictions estimate population mean single sample eg 30 observations rely central limit theorem even population isnâ€™t normal distribution sample means becomes normal using sample mean standard error ïƒâˆšn build confidence intervals 95 confidence interval means 95 samples taken repeatedly would means within range reflecting uncertainty estimate regression fscore evaluates modelâ€™s overall relationship significant comparing explained vs unexplained variance anova tables summarize metrics like degrees freedom df significance f pvalue model standard error measures precision pvalues test meaningfully impact outcome tools together assess modelâ€™s validity variable importance,106,3,-20.937641,-0.5590869,3,0.79468817,9

in  today's session, we focused on key concepts in data science and statistical analysis, including a review of regression metrics, sampling distributions, and the central limit theorem (clt). from the uploaded document, we explored metrics such as sse (sum of squared errors), mse (mean squared error), rmse (root mean squared error), and mae (mean absolute error), which are essential for assessing the performance of linear regression models. these metrics help quantify the model's ability to explain variations in the data and its accuracy in predicting outcomes. the document also introduced the idea that regression coefficients derived from sample data are estimates of population parameters, emphasizing the importance of evaluating their reliability.

to understand this reliability, we examined the concept of sampling distributions, where multiple representative samples are drawn from a population to calculate sample means. these means tend to form a normal distribution as per the central limit theorem, regardless of the original population distribution, provided the sample size is sufficiently large. this principle allows statisticians to infer population characteristics and calculate confidence intervals for model parameters. by reducing uncertainty with larger sample sizes, the standard error of the sampling distribution decreases, improving the precision of estimates. and then we made this on excel sheet and plotted histogram for errors and drew best fit line using linear regression. the discussion highlighted the theoretical and practical importance of these concepts for creating generalizable and reliable models in data science.",focused key concepts science statistical analysis including review regression metrics sampling distributions central limit theorem clt uploaded document explored metrics sse sum squared errors mse mean squared error rmse root mean squared error mae mean absolute error essential assessing performance linear regression models metrics help quantify models ability explain variations accuracy predicting outcomes document also introduced idea regression coefficients derived sample estimates population parameters emphasizing importance evaluating reliability understand reliability examined concept sampling distributions multiple representative samples drawn population calculate sample means means tend form normal distribution per central limit theorem regardless original population distribution provided sample size sufficiently large principle allows statisticians infer population characteristics calculate confidence intervals model parameters reducing uncertainty larger sample sizes standard error sampling distribution decreases improving precision estimates made excel sheet plotted histogram errors drew best fit line using linear regression highlighted theoretical practical importance concepts creating generalizable reliable models science,147,3,-23.734806,2.789249,3,0.7895603,10

366,"in this session, the instructor discussed several key statistical concepts, including error distributions, standard error, sample means, and the central limit theorem (clt). a significant takeaway was that for regression models to accurately reflect the true trend in the data, the errors must be normally distributed. if the errors can be predicted, it suggests that the model has not fully captured the underlying trend of the sample, which may lead to biased results.

the session outlined how to estimate the population mean from a sample, which involves three main steps:

1.) first, calculate the sample mean, assuming it is close to 0. the standard error (sxbar) is found by dividing the population's standard deviation (sigma) by the square root of the sample size (n).
2.) next, compute the sampleâ€™s standard deviation, assuming it is a good estimate of the population's standard deviation.
3.) finally, calculate the standard deviation of the sample distribution, which is essential for determining the confidence interval (ci) that indicates where the population mean is likely to be. for example, a 95% ci means that 95 out of 100 sample means will fall within that range.

the session also delved into the concept of standard error, which reflects how much the sample mean might differ from the actual population mean. for a normal distribution, the standard error is calculated as
ð‘ /âˆšð‘›
, where ð‘  represents the sample standard deviation and ð‘› is the sample size.

following this, the instructor explained the differences between normal and t distributions. when the population standard deviation is known, the errors follow a normal distribution. conversely, if the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is less than 30, the data adheres to a t distribution. the z-statistic and t-statistic serve as test statistics for normal and t distributions, respectively.

the concept of the p-value was introduced, with a focus on its connection to the confidence interval. a low p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, while a high p-value suggests weak evidence. the session also pointed out that if ð›½1 in the regression equation ð‘¦=ð›½0+ð›½1(ð‘¥) is statistically equivalent to 0, then the regression model lacks significance.

additionally, the session delved into multiple linear regression and anova (analysis of variance) as methods for comparing statistical equivalence among multiple averages. the f-statistic, calculated as ð‘€ð‘†ð‘…/ð‘€ð‘†ð¸, is utilized to evaluate the overall fit of a model in anova, determining whether the group means differ significantly.

we also discussed the standard error of the mean, which measures the variability of sample means and is calculated as:
standardâ errorâ (se)=s/âˆšn
here, s is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size. we observed that when we take multiple samples, the means of these samples form a normal distribution, with their mean serving as the best estimate for the population mean. probabilities in these contexts are often expressed in terms of the p-value, which indicates the likelihood of observing a result as extreme as the one we obtained, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
then we studied the anova (analysis of variance) table, which is used to assess whether there are statistically significant differences among the means of three or more groups. this is a key tool for comparing group means in experimental data.

333,"sampling distribution of the mean is a normal distribution. if we assume the sample standard deviation to be equal to the population standard deviation, we can approximate population distribution.
statistical significance is decided by the confidence level. 90% or 95% confidence level is used in practical scenarios. it directly links to the area under the curve of the normal distribution and can even be thought of as a probability.
regression inherently assumes normal distribution of errors. it is useless if not a single one of the coefficients is statistically same as zero.
statistically same means that the coefficient lies in the 90 or 95% confidence interval of zero. the are under the curve outside of the regression coefficient (or the probability that the absolute value of a random variable drawn from the normal distribution is more than the absolute value of the regression coefficient) is given by the p-value. hence, it should be less than 0.5 for 95& confidence considerations.

it starts by calculating the sample mean and assuming itâ€™s close to the population mean. for large samples, the sampling distribution of the mean is roughly normal . to measure how much the sample mean might vary, we calculate the standard error , which is the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size . confidence intervals are then used to estimate the range where the population mean is likely to fall. for smaller samples, we switch to the t-distribution instead of the normal one. basically, confidence intervals help show how uncertain we are about the population mean, and they give us a range where itâ€™s likely to be. for example, if we repeatedly took samples, 95% of their means would fall within this interval.

linear regression is about modeling the relationship between two variables using the equation . here,  represents how much  changes when  changes. if  turns out to be zero (statistically), the model doesnâ€™t work. to check this, we look at the confidence interval of â€”if it includes zero, the regression isnâ€™t significant. a small p-value (like less than 0.05) tells us  is significantly different from zero, which means the model is valid.

for multiple linear regression (mlr), we extend this to include more predictors, so the equation becomes . to evaluate the modelâ€™s overall significance, we use anova (analysis of variance). the -statistic helps us compare the variability explained by the model (msr) to the variability left unexplained (mse). if the -statistic is significant, it means the model works as a whole.

2. p value: kind of says how statistically close is to say this estimated coefficent is zero.if it is close to zero, one can conclude that the coefficient is statistically insignificant from zero, if the value is close to one, it is statistically significant to zero, meaning this variable has little to no effect in the prediction.
3. standard error and confidence intervals: any point estimate for the population parameter exactly has zero probability of being the real value, thus it is always best to assign a interval and say, with x% confidence i can say, any sample mean will lie in this interval. for this, we first assume that the standard deviation of the sample is standard deviation of the population and compute the standard error, which is std/square_root_of(n)[n being the number of observations in the sample]. for 95% confidence one level, mu-2*standard_error to mu+2*standard_error is the interval.

to make this determination, we used different samples and obtained the distribution of coefficient. this distribution is assumed to be normal, and its spread is quantified by the standard error, calculated from the given data. using this information, we can construct confidence intervals to identify the range within which coefficients is most likely to be in. 
the concept of a p-value also verifies it. a small p-value, typically less than 0.05, indicates that the coefficient is significantly different from zero. this statistical significance tells that  the observed relationship between  x  and  y  is meaningful.

429,"one small insight i learned in todayâ€™s class is that one sample can have multiple observations because a sample is like a smaller set of data taken from the entire population.

in todayâ€™s class, we focused on confidence intervals and why theyâ€™re important.

we spent almost half of the class understanding how we can use a sample to figure out the populationâ€™s parameters, like the mean, by making some assumptions:

1. the sample represents the population well.
2. the standard deviation of the sample is roughly the same as the standard deviation of the population.

to estimate the population mean, we used the **central limit theorem**. it says that if you have a sample size n>30, you can use the z-distribution to calculate the confidence interval. if n<30, you use the t-distribution instead.

toward the end of the class, we looked at the **anova table** in excel and tried to understand some of the values it gives, like:

- **p-stats**: this is calculated using the formula:
    - p-stats= (x - x_) / (standard_deviation / sqrt(n)) ; where n is the number of samples
- **p-value**: this tells us how good a regression model is. it checks if the parameter î²1 (slope of the regression line) is statistically different from 0. if the p-value is very small, it means î²1 is significant, so the regression line is meaningful. if the p-value is large, it means î²1 is not statistically different from 0, which implies thereâ€™s no slope, and therefore no valid regression line.

we also discussed why confidence intervals are helpful. they donâ€™t just give us a single estimate (like the mean) but a range where the actual value is likely to fall. this makes our predictions more reliable.

lastly, the class touched on how these concepts connect to regression analysis. for example, when using the regression output in excel, understanding the p-value, confidence intervals, and other stats helps us decide if the model is good enough or needs improvement.",one small insight learned todayâ€™s class one sample multiple observations sample like smaller set taken entire population todayâ€™s class focused confidence intervals theyâ€™re important spent almost half class understanding use sample figure populationâ€™s parameters like mean making assumptions 1 sample represents population well 2 standard deviation sample roughly standard deviation population estimate population mean central limit theorem says sample size n30 use zdistribution calculate confidence interval n30 use tdistribution instead toward end class looked anova table excel tried understand values gives like pstats calculated using formula pstats x x standarddeviation sqrtn n number samples pvalue tells us good regression model checks parameter î²1 slope regression line statistically different 0 pvalue small means î²1 significant regression line meaningful pvalue large means î²1 statistically different 0 implies thereâ€™s slope therefore valid regression line also confidence intervals helpful donâ€™t give us single estimate like mean range actual value likely fall makes predictions reliable lastly class touched concepts connect regression analysis using regression output excel understanding pvalue confidence intervals stats helps us decide model good enough needs improvement,174,3,-26.971699,0.14259964,3,0.73740876,36

292,"we started the lecture with a quick recap of the concepts from previous class- including regression coefficients and discussed about the sampling distribution of mean (histogram plots of the sample). we learnt that whatever be the distribution of the population, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will always be normally distributed. we donâ€™t have the opportunity to take multiple samples. we can practically take a single sample, which can have multiple observations. so, using these â€˜statisticsâ€™ values, we have to estimate the population parameters. so, while taking up a sample, we assume that it is a â€˜goodâ€™ representative of the population.
so, our first step towards estimating the population parameters, is to calculate the mean of sample, by assuming that it is close to population mean.
then we find out the sample standard distribution, assuming that it is close to population standard distribution. so, our ultimate goal is to find out an interval around the calculated value of sample mean, within which we can say with certain confidence level that our population mean would lie. for our sample observations, we make different categories/â€™binsâ€™ in which we divide the data values. then we plot a histogram (frequency distribution graph) for these bins. we observe that as we start decreasing the width of the class, the curve becomes smoother and smoother. this curve has a gaussian normal distribution.
if we divide the frequency values for various bins, by the total frequency, we get the probability that a certain data point will lie within that bin. the area under the curve within that interval, gives us the value of probability. 
so, when we say there is a 95% confidence interval, by it we mean that- if you take 100 samples, then 95 out of these would lie in that interval. also, the area under the curve within this interval would be 0.95. these plots are called â€˜probability density function(pdf)â€™.
if the number of observations is less than 30, then the distribution becomes a â€˜tâ€™ distribution, rather than a normal distribution.
the normal(or t) distribution is centered around the mean, and its tails extend to infinity on both the sides. for an interval, say (a,b), any value within this is â€˜not statistically differentâ€™ from the mean. but any value out of this interval can be said to be â€˜statistically differentâ€™ from the mean values. it may also come from an entirely different population. 
so, if we want to check whether a model is truly a slr model, we can check whether the coefficient of x, i.e. 'a' is statistically different from 0 or not. if it is, then we may conclude that the model is appropriate.
we consider that 0 is the at the centre of the distribution and then define an interval for 95% confidence, we want the value of the regression coefficient to lie outside this, so as to make our regression model valid.
twice the area under the curve from the point, which corresponds to the regression coefficient, to infinity is termed as the â€˜p-valueâ€™. so, for a 95% confidence interval, we want our p-value to be less than 0.05.
we can use this for multiple linear regression as well. those independent variables that have corresponding p-values, greater than 0.05(95% confidence) can be neglected in the regression expression.
lastly, we talked about anova- analysis of variance, which is a tool that tells you what is the statistic probability that at least one of the coefficients in mlr is non zero.

after this sir went explain statistics and explained estimation of parameter using statistics. then sir explained about the gaussian normal distribution. if the number of observations is less than 30, we wont get a normal distribution. we would get a t- distribution. so generally when the number of observations are less than 30, we must use t distribution. we started with a sample and we are able to say with x% confidence that population mean lies in an interval. 95% confidence interval- ""if you take 100 samples, the mean of 95 of those samples will lie in this interval. t=(x-u)/std.dev
p value: we have a sample and we calculated 95% confidence interval. we get a new set of observations - sample 2 and sample 3. the mean of sample 2 lies in the confidence interval whereas mean of sample 3 does not lie in confidence interval. we can say that sample 2 belongs to the population and sample 3 does not belong to population. 
when a=0 (y=ax+b) becomes zero, we can't use linear regression.  we find the distribution of a. we have a calculated value of a. we find the confidence interval. if zero lies in this confidence interval, we cant have linear regression.  (statistically all values in confidence interval are similar). p value is the area under curve between x=b1 and infinity *2. p value is determined by the position of b1. for the regression to be nice, p value has to be less than 0.05.(for b1 to lie outside the confidence interval, p value has to be less than 0.05). b1 should lie outside confidence interval because we need 0 and b1 to be statistically different.",class started recap previous class one inherent assumption closed form linear regression errors normally distributed violated take care whatever distribution sample take multiple samples calculate mean samples always get normal distribution means samples lets suppose one sample 30 observations step1 calculate mean samplehere assume calculated mean close population mean many sample means would form normal distributionusrootn step2 get sample std dev assume close samples std deviation step3 calculate sigmarootn describe normal distribution want get interval within population mean likely lie using excel python tools create particular distribution sir went explain statistics explained estimation parameter using statistics sir explained gaussian normal distribution number observations less 30 wont get normal distribution would get distribution generally number observations less 30 must use distribution started sample able say x confidence population mean lies interval 95 confidence interval take 100 samples mean 95 samples lie interval txustddev p value sample calculated 95 confidence interval get new set observations sample 2 sample 3 mean sample 2 lies confidence interval whereas mean sample 3 lie confidence interval say sample 2 belongs population sample 3 belong population a0 yaxb becomes zero cant use linear regression find distribution calculated value find confidence interval zero lies confidence interval cant linear regression statistically values confidence interval similar p value area curve xb1 infinity 2 p value determined position b1 regression nice p value less 005for b1 lie outside confidence interval p value less 005 b1 lie outside confidence interval need 0 b1 statistically different,243,3,-27.848766,-1.1569633,3,0.6929449,45

2. sample vs. population  
   - the given dataset (x, y) represents a sample (99 observations), and the calculated regression coefficients (intercept 'a' and slope 'b') are only estimates of the true population values.  
   - the goal is to develop a general model that can predict values beyond the given sample and reflect the actual population behavior.

     - adjusted r square: adjusts râ² for the number of predictors, providing a more accurate measure when multiple variables are involved.  
     - standard error: indicates the average error in predictions.  
     - observations: number of data points used in the model.  

   - anova (analysis of variance)  
     - ss (sum of squares): measures total variation in data, divided into regression (explained) and residual (unexplained) parts.  
     - ms (mean squares): average squared deviation, derived from ss.  
     - f-statistic: tests the overall significance of the regression model.  
     - significance f (p-value): determines if the independent variable has a statistically significant effect on the dependent variable.

531,"in today's session, we learn about the difference between sample and population. the variables in population are known as parameters and we use statistics on samples to estimate these parameters. there are various models and methods to estimate the parameters based on the type of data. the estimated function can be simple or difficult depending on the attributes. after estimating the parameters we give a confidence interval i.e how sure we are on the estimates we have provided. the estimates are generally range of values of a and b and larger the range higher is the confidence interval.
one such model was linear regression, where the best-fit representation is a straight line of the form y=a+ b*x where a and b are point estimates.
'a' is also known as bias which represents for all other variables/attributes we haven't taken into account. in linear regression we minimise the sum of square of errors as minimising the   sum of errors does not give accurate measurement. we also don't take absolute values of error as it is having manhattan distance and square area of influence. using this model we can interpolate this to predict the output based on the provided input with a given error limit.

325,"today we learned about sample statistics and estimating the sample mean. estimating the sample mean and hypothesis testing are fundamental concepts in statistics, commonly used to draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.

the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean, calculated by summing the values in a sample and dividing by the number of observations. it is an approximation for the population mean when it is impractical to collect data from every member of the population. the sample mean is unbiased, meaning its expected value equals the population mean. however, variability exists across different samples, and the sample meanâ€™s accuracy increases with larger sample sizes, as stated by the central limit theorem (clt).

hypothesis testing is a method to assess claims or hypotheses about a population parameter, such as the mean. the process starts with the formulation of a null hypothesis (hâ‚€) and an alternative hypothesis (hâ‚). using sample data, a test statistic is calculated, and its significance is determined by a p-value, which indicates the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true. a common threshold is 0.05; if the p-value is smaller than this threshold, the null hypothesis is rejected. hypothesis tests, like t-tests, are widely used to determine if there is enough evidence to support or refute a claim about a population parameter, balancing false positive and false negative errors. 

we also discussed the normal and t-distributions, the latter having more weight in the tails and hence reflecting a higher probability of outliers. t-tests are used for n<30.",learned sample statistics estimating sample mean estimating sample mean hypothesis testing fundamental concepts statistics commonly draw conclusions population based sample sample mean point estimate population mean calculated summing values sample dividing number observations approximation population mean impractical collect every member population sample mean unbiased meaning expected value equals population mean however variability exists across different samples sample meanâ€™s accuracy increases larger sample sizes stated central limit theorem clt hypothesis testing method assess claims hypotheses population parameter mean process starts formulation null hypothesis hâ‚€ alternative hypothesis hâ‚ using sample test statistic calculated significance determined pvalue indicates probability observing null hypothesis true common threshold 005 pvalue smaller threshold null hypothesis rejected hypothesis tests like ttests widely determine enough evidence support refute claim population parameter balancing false positive false negative errors also normal tdistributions latter weight tails hence reflecting higher probability outliers ttests n30,141,3,-26.373058,0.8860801,3,0.6608214,53

in general linear regression, we can have multiple features as well as multiple outputs, which can be expressed in matrix form.

to assess the variance captured per independent variable (degree of freedom), we adjust for the sample mean. since knowing the sample mean reduces the number of independent data points by one, the degree of freedom decreases. the sample mean is used in both ssr (sum of squares for regression) and sst (total sum of squares).

a model is poor if the confidence interval contains zero because a regression coefficient of zero in linear regression produces a horizontal line, which is undesirable.

y as a linear combination of various variables. we want to find the correct coefficients for the variables. as there is no closed-form solution, we will use an method called gradient descent.

658,"we started with the revision of some concepts from the previous class, whereby we had discussed about the sampling distribution of the sample mean. today we defined some new terms with regards to that histogram. we defined the standard deviation of the sampling distribution or the standard error s_x_bar, which is equal to the population standard deviation upon the square root of the number of observation in the sample. today's discussion revolved around the idea that we might not have a lot of samples for each and every data. we may have only one sample in some cases. in that case, how can we make predictions or analyse the parameters of the population, using the statistics of the given sample. one highlight point is that the sampling distribution is always normally distributed i.e. it has a normal distribution which can be expressed as n(mu, sigma), where mu is the population mean and sigma is the population standard deviation. suppose we have only one sample. we can find the mean of all the observations in this sample and assume that it is the mean of the population. then we can also calculate the standard deviation of our sample and we again assume that it is the standard deviation of the population. both these assumptions rely on the fact that ideally, a sample should be a good representation of the population. then we get both mu and sigma for the sampling distribution and since it is normally distributed, we get the distribution as well. now we can calculate the boundary points of the area of 95% confidence level. we also studied that the area under the normal distribution curve, is actually the probability that the mean of the sample lies in that range. hence, we can get two boundary points, within which the area under the curve is 0.95. we also divide our frequency of sample means by the total number of means, so that our graph is normalised and we directly get the probabilities from the area under the curve. the total area under the curve is 1. 
we went on to say that if our no. of observations in the sample are less than 30, then we get a t distribution instead of normal distribution. hence, we understood the terms lower 95% and upper 95%. we also talked about p value, which is basically 2 times the area under the distribution curve beyond the point where our regression coefficient lies. we said that the lower the p value, the better is our regression model.

we started with stating out a formal assumption: in closed form solution, errors are always normally distributed. whatever be the distribution of the population, when we take out multiple samples and plot a histogram as a continuous frequency function, it forms a normal distribution.
next we discussed about the 3 steps to perform while estimating population mean from a sample
1. calculate the mean of the sample
2. get the sample standard deviation and assume it to be close to population standard deviation
3. now you can get the standard error
than based on the confidence interval, you can get the most likely population mean based on your confidence interval.

458,"in today's class, we first see that the regression coefficient beta1 should not be zero for a particular sample out of the solution, so the model is not good. the confidence interval of beta1 should not contain zero. suppose we have taken two samples, and we get the value of beta1 to be a and b if they both lie inside the confidence interval, then they are statistically the same, and if anyone is outside it, then they are statistically different. if we have o in the interval and the p-value of the coefficient is higher than 0.05, then we don't consider that coefficient, but if the p-value is less, we can consider the coefficient. then, we move on to analyzing the summary we wrote about the class, noticing some of the summaries have similarities. still, they will be different, especially based on the vocabulary. then, we move on to multiple linear regression, where the dependent variable y is based on more than one independent variable. we can get the model from the data by the gradient descent method. then we perform the data analysis on data on which mlr can be done and we get the value of r^2 of nearly 0.83, which is very good stating the model was a good fit, but the y variable was not exactly dependent on all x. there was 0 in the confidence interval so we removed the coefficient with a p-value greater than 0.05 and the highest among the coefficients, doing these we reduced the regressions coefficient to 3 including the intercept and now the p-value for all them was less than 0.05. these tell that whether the data contains various x which changes y but all do not significantly changes the value of y, and those x who do not impact y significantly can not be taken into consideration.",class first see regression coefficient beta1 zero particular sample solution model good confidence interval beta1 contain zero suppose taken two samples get value beta1 b lie inside confidence interval statistically anyone outside statistically different interval pvalue coefficient higher 005 dont consider coefficient pvalue less consider coefficient move analyzing wrote class noticing summaries similarities still different especially based vocabulary move multiple linear regression dependent variable based one independent variable get model gradient descent method perform analysis mlr done get value r2 nearly 083 good stating model good fit variable exactly dependent x 0 confidence interval removed coefficient pvalue greater 005 highest among coefficients reduced regressions coefficient 3 including intercept pvalue less 005 tell whether contains x changes significantly changes value x impact significantly taken consideration,124,3,-17.384483,-5.4045615,3,0.5962321,68
304,"in today's session we went forward with more statistics.
whatever the distribution of the population, the sampling distribution of the mean will always be a normal distribution.

problem: you have only one sample (eg. 30 observations). in real life, many times it is not possible to get multiple samples. we need to estimate the population mean based only on s1.

for this we are assuming that the sample is representative of the population.

step 1: calculate the sample mean. (assume this mean is close to the population mean)
now sampling distribution of the mean => normal(mu, sigma).
s(xbar) = sigma/sqrt(x) = s/sqrt(x)      
{sigma: population standard deviation ; s: sample standard deviation}

step 2: calculate the sample standard deviation and assume it to be close to population standard deviation.

we want to get the interval within which the population mean is likely to lie.

also, if the number of observations is less than 30 then instead of normal the sampling distribution follows t-distribution.

95% confidence interval:
if you take 100 samples, the mean of 95 of those samples will lie between the lower and upper limits of the interval.

then we discussed about t-value = (x - mu)/standard deviation

p-value:
y = b0 + b1*x
if b1 is statistically equal to zero, then we do not have a regression.
if b1 lies in the 95% confidence interval of normal distribution with mean=0 and sigma=same as that of the sampling distribution of b1 then it is statistically equal to zero.

p-value should be less than 0.05.

multiple linear regression:
y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 +...+bk*xk

204,"at first, we discussed a few concepts from the previous class, which were wrongly interpreted. one of these was that the p-value (95% confidence interval) represents the area under the curve, which lies outside the interval, from both the sides. so, it is correct to say that for p-value<0.05, the coefficients are statistically significant and must be included in the regression model. or we can say that the area under the curve, outside the interval on either of the sides must be less than 0.025. the other misconception was about the solution for the mlr model. solving the equations can give us a closed-form solution in theory, but practically, it is difficult to achieve. hence, we look for numerical methods to get approximate solutions, which are not closed form. finding such exact solutions is not practically possible as it involves calculating lots of matrix inversions. these calculations are difficult as the size of these matrices is very large. also, many times, there is multicollinearity in the independent variables. this means that these â€˜independentâ€™ variables are not really independent. if these problems are not addressed, then it can lead us to an unstable solution, which may not work out for a longer time and will eventually have to be reformed, to correctly predict the newly evolving data.
after this, we went further to discuss how exactly the procedure is carried out, to analyze the data and develop models that correctly explains it. whatever sample we chose, should never be used completely to train our model. a part of it (80% or 10%) should be reserved as the â€˜test dataâ€™ and can be used to test our model later. how much part of the data is reserved for testing depends on the size of the data. if we have large data then we can keep 20% for testing and rest for training the model. but if the data size is small, then maybe we will have to use more than 90% to train the model. if we keep on decreasing the data for training the model, at a certain point it would be insufficient to train the model and this small amount of data may not as well represent the population well.
 after we prepare a model based on our training data and use the test data to check whether this model correctly predicts the outcome, we can get two different types of metrics.
first is the training metrics. this includes the error metrics associated with the training data. next, we have test metrics, which includes the error metrics associated with the test data. some metrics are relevant to both of these (like r2), while some are specific to each of these. so, if r2 of both the sets match, we can fairly conclude that the model is good enough. however, if we have some model which overfits the training data (r2=1) then this model will not be good for the test data. the example which we discussed in class was that a curve which passes through all the points of the training data does not fit the test data well. but a best fit line for the training data is a better model for the test data. we then talked about another metric i.e. multiple r. it gives us an idea about the correlation between y and various independent variables. 
adjusted r2 is another metric which we discussed. adjusted r2 penalizes addition of excessive independent variables. it keeps on decreasing if we add more and more variables which do not improve the model.
so, it gives an idea of how effective the addition of new variables is.
as we predicted the y values using the mlr model and plotted these against the corresponding x values, we got a best fitting curve. so, linear regression will not always give as a straight line. it just states that the y is a linear combination of the independent variables and y may also be a non- linear. we had a discussion about parametric and non- parametric models. slr and mlr are defined as parametric models as they involve parameters ( intercept, beta1, beta2â€¦). these parameters have p -value associated with them. 
random forests and decision tree are examples of non-parametric models. they don't involve any parameters and hence don't have any p-values associated with them.
so, while comparing between models from these two categories, we may use r2 and rmse error metrics instead of p-values. these metrics are common to both of these models. at the end of the class, we learnt how we can use the python libraries like scikit-learn and statsmodel to perform these regressions and give us the values of these various metrics.
scikit-learn doesn't return us some metrics, so we used another library which is statsmodel, in which we used ols (ordinary least square algorithm). this gave us a variety of different metrics- including kurtosis, skewness, aic, bic, t-statistics, p-values, and results for few tests for normality and correlation between residuals, like durbin watson, omnibus test, jarque-bera test.

604,"today's class start with a discussion on the value of beta_1, which is statistically significant or not. instead of checking if zero lies between beta_1l and  beta_1h, we can alternatively check if beta_1 lies within /  outside the 90% or 95% confidence interval defined  around zero. so, if beta_1 is within the confidence interval around zero, it is not statistically significant, and if it outside the ci around  zero it is said to be statistically significant.
the p_value associated with beta_1 tells us about the  position of beta_1 w.r.t. zero. if p_values is less than  0.05, then beta_1 is outside the 95% ci around zero and hence it is statistically significant. the opposite is true if the  p_values is greater than 0.05. further ahead we talked about the multiple linear regression, we have y=b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3... here [x1, x2, x3, x4....] are the independent variables, also known as features. in mlr our goal is to express 'y' as a linear combination of x1, x2, x3..... . examples like -> a) photos-> the pixels in photos can be considered as features. b) in case of ""text"" we convert it into vectors by a method embedding. c) in sales prediction we have features like age, earning and location. next we learned about the gradient descent method which is an optimization technique which are used to find the minimum of function by updating it values until minimum not found.

in classification, we have seen that using two different models causes more problems at the intersection points.
then we started with ""logistic unit and logistic regression"". the logistic unit predicts the probability that whether data belongs to class 1 or class 0. it doesn't predict the class. the probability function used here is the sigmoid function, which gives the probability that given data point x belongs to class y. if p(y/x) is greater than 0.5 then  x belongs to class y. then we see how the weight matrix is calculated in logistic regression. we formulated a likelihood function so that on maximizing likelihood we get the desired weight matrix. however, maximizing is not a stable method so we introduced a negative sign in likelihood and now minimize the negated likelihood to get weight matrix.
at last, we saw the ""confusion matrix"" and ""quality metrics"" like accuracy = (true positive + true negative)/total, precision = of all events you detected, how many are detected correctly, recall = of the specific class, how many you able to detect correctly, f1 score which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

126,"we started with logistic regression and found out how we could find the weights that will drive our predictions. our aim is to bring our predicted results as close to the real targets as possible. when the actual value is 1, we want our predicted probability to be high; if it is 0, then low. this requires taking that into consideration for all of the observations in our training data.

since dealing with product terms can grow complicated, we take the log of the likelihood function, and turn multiplication into addition, so turning things over is significantly easier. maximizing this gives us the minimum amount of error possible, and hence finds us the best fit for our model.

for analysing whether or not our model was a good fit, we use a confusion matrix, which categorizes predictions into four groups:

- true negatives (tn):correctly predicted negatives 

- false positives (fp):positives wrongly predicted (false alarms) 

- false negatives (fn):negatives wrongly predicted (missing actual positives) 

- true positives (tp):correctly classified as positive 

by using all of this, we get a number of valuable performance metrics: 
- the ratio of the correctness of outputs from the model for majority of the cases. 
accuracy= (tp + tn)/total count of observations

- precision:when the model indicates something is positive, how frequently is it truly accurate? 

- recall:among all the true positive instances, how many did the model accurately recognize? 

- f1-score:a compromise between precision and recall. unlike accuracy, which may be deceptive in the presence of imbalanced data, the f1-score accounts for both precision and recall, avoiding misplaced confidence in the model's effectiveness.

in summary, precision indicates the trustworthiness of our positive predictions, recall measures our effectiveness in identifying positives, and the f1-score guarantees we remain realistic about our accuracy.",started logistic regression found could find weights drive predictions aim bring predicted results close real targets possible actual value 1 want predicted probability high 0 low requires taking consideration observations training since dealing product terms grow complicated take log likelihood function turn multiplication addition turning things significantly easier maximizing gives us minimum amount error possible hence finds us best fit model analysing whether model good fit use confusion matrix categorizes predictions four groups true negatives tncorrectly predicted negatives false positives fppositives wrongly predicted false alarms false negatives fnnegatives wrongly predicted missing actual positives true positives tpcorrectly classified positive using get number valuable performance metrics ratio correctness outputs model majority cases accuracy tp tntotal count observations precisionwhen model indicates something positive frequently truly accurate recallamong true positive instances many model accurately recognize f1scorea compromise precision recall unlike accuracy may deceptive presence imbalanced f1score accounts precision recall avoiding misplaced confidence models effectiveness precision indicates trustworthiness positive predictions recall measures effectiveness identifying positives f1score guarantees remain realistic accuracy,165,4,2.588174,-25.064775,4,0.72850263,22

32,"we discussed the idea that using one model is often better than combining two models, as combining them might lead to discontinuities at the boundary. then, we moved on to logistic regression, introducing the concept of a logistic unit, which has two possible states: 0 and 1. we considered a function in the form of a linear combination of input variables: w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + b. since the output needs to be either 0 or 1, we introduced the sigmoid function, which converts this linear function into a probability value.

the probability function p(y|x) was then defined as sigma(w^t x + b). if a point belongs to class 1, the predicted value should be close to 1; otherwise, it should be close to 0. the goal was to maximize the likelihood of the predicted outcome matching the actual target. when t = 1, we maximize p, and when t = 0, we maximize (1 - p). this led to the definition of the likelihood function as a product over all data points: p^t (1 - p)^(1 - t). to make optimization easier, we took the log of this function, leading to the log-likelihood expression. since finding a minimum is often more stable than finding a maximum, we defined j as -log l and minimized it using gradient descent. the weight parameters w1, w2, ..., wn were updated iteratively with a learning rate (eta).

we also discussed that the decision boundary does not necessarily have to be linear. then, we introduced the confusion matrix, which contains true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. the accuracy metric was defined as (tp + tn) / total. however, it was noted that accuracy is not always a good measure, especially when data is imbalanced. if one class has significantly more data points than the other, accuracy might still appear high despite poor performance on the minority class. to address this, we introduced precision and recall as alternative evaluation metrics.

in the end of the class we discussed the topics of assignment e1, and the common mistakes most people made, like directly using kurtosis function from excel without checking if we need the positive kurtosis or negative kurtosis, and in q1 which involved comparison between the two models, the slope terms weren't same which most people just subtracted intercept term from predictions and used it for comparison. general: excel file should be submitted along with calculations and formulas, not just values. and put in more effort during documentation and organize well.",beginning class questions raised students previous topics class expectation algebra histogram showing particular distribution many bins consider consider division two clusters boundary consider model changes regression expression according ranges x either going two different forests method continued previous class logistic unit logistic regression soft max function redistributes numbers around 0 1 p05 push one class otherwise push another class saw notations logistic regression 3 model examples y1 y2 known outcomes also referred calculate weights wi likelihood getting desired targets maximized another way saying minimize differences known target denoted find likelihood using function maximising l get desired weights wi expression l satisfy two requirements t1 would getting maximum p t0 getting maximum 1p likelihood product based function easier deal summation form take log likelihood way maxima always unstable minima stable points use gradient descent method also defined something like n learning rate saw confusion matrix cases tn fn fp tp examples associated false negatives disastrous cases scenarios like sick told youre definition accuracy able correctly identify situation close measurement actual value definition precision events detected many correctly close measurements observations definition recall specific class many could correctly identify f1 value defined harmonic mean value precision recall end class topics assignment e1 common mistakes people made like directly using kurtosis function excel without checking need positive kurtosis negative kurtosis q1 involved comparison two models slope terms werent people subtracted intercept term predictions comparison general excel file submitted along calculations formulas values put effort documentation organize well,244,4,-1.1058896,-27.039759,4,0.69447917,29

561,"we define the boundary for classification as a linear combination of features. this is then passed through the sigmoid function so that we can treat the output as a probability, specifically the probability that the label is 1 given the features. the prediction output is done by rounding this probability to the nearest integer (0 or 1).
the four possible cases of predicted and actual labels (both can be 0 or 1) are represented in a matrix form called the confusion matrix. many metrics can be derived here, for e.g. precision, recall, accuracy. f1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and it is a better metric than accuracy in the case where the data is imbalanced. when there are more sample from a particular class in the training dataset, then the classifier can achieve a high accuracy by trivially detecting every input as belonging to the dominant class. f1 score counters this by providing a value based on the precision and recall which themselves focus on number of correct predictions from those predicted and for each class how many were identified correctly respectively.",define boundary classification linear combination features passed sigmoid function treat output probability specifically probability label 1 given features prediction output done rounding probability nearest integer 0 1 four possible cases predicted actual labels 0 1 represented matrix form called confusion matrix many metrics derived eg precision recall accuracy f1 score harmonic mean precision recall metric accuracy case imbalanced sample particular class training dataset classifier achieve high accuracy trivially detecting every input belonging dominant class f1 score counters providing value based precision recall focus number correct predictions predicted class many identified correctly respectively,92,4,4.9305644,-29.998255,4,0.68980813,31
127,"today we started with discussing more upon logistic regression. we talked about logistic unit, which is basically the probability of an observed data to be in the labelled class. so this is basically a conditional probability, that is p(y when x occurred). a convention we used in class is that the probabilities are denoted by p and the labels are denoted by t. to calculate the loss function here we usually use log to ease calculations.
the metrics in this model is mainly the confusion matrix. it is a 2 v 2 matrix with true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative. then there is precession and recall, precession is defined by the number of observations we classified correctly. and recall is for a particular class, that is how many have we classified correctly under that class. and another term if defined as f1 which is the harmonic mean of the above two.

131,"in today's class, we first saw that the mean can be the expected value from the x sample. then we saw that different bin widths can give us different patterns in the histogram. in excel, there is a certain mechanism through which it sets the bin size initially but we need to choose the number of bins or bin width based on what we are looking for in the histogram. then we saw that to calculate the standard error, if we have just one sample, we take the standard deviation of the population to be equal to the standard deviation of that sample. then we continue with logistic regression where we name the clusters as class label 1, label 2, etc., and make boundaries to separate them. suppose we are getting a=w1.x1+w2x2+w3.x3+b then we need a function that will convert a into either 0 or 1. we use the sigmoid function p(y|x)=sigma(a)=(1/(1+(1/e^a))), the prediction is 1 if p(y/x) is greater than 0.5 and else it is zero. then we saw the metrics associated with the classification like true positive is when it is 1 or 'yes' and prediction is also 1, and false positive is when it is 0 or 'no' and predicted is 'yes'. accuracy tells us about how often the classifier is correct. suppose in a case there are 100 points of one class and 5 of another, then still if we do not consider the 5 points, the accuracy is high though, this is the case of data imbalance. then we saw precision means off the events that are detected, how many have we detected correctly and recall is off the specific class, how many did we classify correctly. at last, we got the feedback from tas regarding e1, it points out the point that we should calculate the error kurtosis using its formula and not through excel's inbuilt function, and we also that we should document our observations properly, adding all the relevant things so that the reader can understand your conclusions by reading the document.",class first saw mean expected value x sample saw different bin widths give us different patterns histogram excel certain mechanism sets bin size initially need choose number bins bin width based looking histogram saw calculate standard error one sample take standard deviation population equal standard deviation sample continue logistic regression name clusters class label 1 label 2 etc make boundaries separate suppose getting aw1x1w2x2w3x3b need function convert either 0 1 use sigmoid function pyxsigmaa111ea prediction 1 pyx greater 05 else zero saw metrics associated classification like true positive 1 yes prediction also 1 false positive 0 predicted yes accuracy tells us often classifier correct suppose case 100 points one class 5 another still consider 5 points accuracy high though case imbalance saw precision means events detected many detected correctly recall specific class many classify correctly last got feedback tas regarding e1 points point calculate error kurtosis using formula excels inbuilt function also document observations properly adding relevant things reader understand conclusions reading document,163,4,-0.39577308,-29.75501,4,0.6617377,33
324,"today's class start with a discussion about  question on 1) how to calculate standard error of one sample 2) how to determine the width of bins of histograms.
starting with first question - we can calculate the standard error of one sample just by supposing that the standard deviation of that sample is equal to the standard deviation of population. in second question the width of bins depends on the problem what we are looking for or we can also done it by using some predefined rules like sturge's rule or freedman diaconis rule. in logistic regression we use sigmoid function in which we get two values either 0 or 1, it gives only probability. the boundary can be non-linear not necessarily to be linear. if we give more flexibility, then it works well on training data but not on test data.
there are many metrics that associated with classification just like  regression - 
1)precision -> of the events we have detected, how many we correctly detected.
2)accuracy-> overall how often is the classifier correct ? in case of data imbalance, it is not a accurate method.
3)recall -> of the specific class how many we have classified correctly

14,"we started off by discussing that with nominal and ordinal data, our observation or data points have an additional characteristic property called as a label. labels basically help us to identify which class that observation belongs to. 
then we took a small detour to understand standard error in detail. we understood that standard error is the variance of the means of different samples of a population. also we discussed about the number of bins which should be considered while plotting histograms. it depends on the data and how deep do we need to analyse the data. if we need to understand broad trends, we can use lesser number of bins, while if we want to find some minute trends, we need to use more bins. 
we came back to logistic regression and discussed about the logistic unit. a logistic unit gives us the probability of an observation being in a particular class. we use the sigmoid function in order to get the exact probabilities, and then map the probability to a particular class. so p(y|x) is calculated as the sigmoid function evaluated at a = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3. now there will always be a difference between the probability value and the actual class label. the probability value is denoted by â€™pâ€™ while the known class outcomes are denoted using â€˜tâ€™. our aim with logistic regression is to maximise the likelihood of our predicted outcomes being close to the targets, or to reduce the difference between the probability value and the target value. so â€˜tâ€™ is the observed outcome i.e. 0 or 1, â€˜pâ€™ is the probability of t=1 and thus, 1-p gives the probability of t=0. our aim is to maximise p or 1-p based on the value of t. now to ease out our calculations and maximisation, we take the log of the probability products, so that they can convert to a summation, and that gives us our loss function which we need to minimise.
we then moved on to some quality metrics which we need to assess our model. we discussed about the confusion matrix and the various terms, true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives. we discussed about accuracy, and how it is not a very good measure in case there is a class imbalance i.e. one class is under-represented and has very few observations. we understood precision, which is defined as of the events that we have detected, how many have we detected correctly. recall is defined as of a specific class, how many have we detected correctly. f1 value is defined is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. these terms give us a better picture of the data and prevent us from being misled by the accuracy.

634,"logistic regression-
most of terms used here are derived from medical field. we have to assign label to each point based on output. we need to find boundaries which separate regions. expectation algebra - same as discussed in probability course last semster. if we don't have standard deviation of population, we assume that standard deviation of sample is same as that of population. to find the number of bins in a histogram there are different methods such as struges rule, rice rule etc based on what we want to infer from the data. even when there are overlapping clusters, we might need a boundary to separate out non overlapping points, overlapping points are dealt later. 
logistic regression doesn't directly predict the class to which the point belongs, it predicts the probability with which it belongs to a particular class. if the number of classes are two it is simple, if probability of y=1 given x is greater than 0.5.  we need to solve the problem of finding a boundary so that misclassification is minimum. our goal is to minimise the difference between .
calculate the weights wi such that the likelihood of getting the desired targets is maximised given the observations. in training phase input data points xj and the output points yj are known. predicted probability is probability of y given x which is sigmoid of w x + b. if there are two classes, if the predicted probability lies close to 1 then it belongs to class 1. we want to maximise the likelihood of our predicted outcomes being close to the targets. log(l) is known as the log likelihood. minimising likelihood is same as maximising log likelihood. see derivation in slides. apply gradient descent to minimise likelihood. the boundary will be decided based on the flexibility. we have random forest classification and random forest regression. we are give a dataset we have to apply some model and then compare the metrics of both models. we have to create a confusion matrix which contains true positive, false positive , true negatives and false negatives. false negative is more dangerous. false positive might incur some additional costs. accuracy=true positive+ true negative / total.( how many observations you have correctly classified. when there is a data imbalance, there is not much impact on accuracy, so it is not correct measure to compare. precision is of the events that you have predicted how many you have predicted correctly. recall value of a specific class how many could you correctly identify. f1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. other metrics include true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate.

also that the life of a data scientist includes spending time with numbers, models, and comparisons. we also discussed what a neural network is: a model made up of layers of nodes (neurons), including input, hidden, and output layers, where hidden layers help detect patterns and improve predictions by adjusting connections between neurons. in regression, we discussed the idea that regression means moving towards mediocrity, implying that extreme values tend to average out over time. logistic regression, however, is not about fitting a line but rather about modeling probabilities using the logistic function. the logistic unit, based on the sigmoid function 1/(1+e^(-x)), acts as a switch by mapping input values between 0 and 1, making it suitable for classification tasks.",class covered forward backward feature selection forward selection adds features one one backward selection removes least important ones aiming improve model performance also compared machine learning models including random forest knn artificial neural networks xgboost etc also life scientist includes spending time numbers models comparisons also neural network model made layers nodes neurons including input hidden output layers hidden layers help detect patterns improve predictions adjusting connections neurons regression idea regression means moving towards mediocrity implying extreme values tend average time logistic regression however fitting line rather modeling probabilities using logistic function logistic unit based sigmoid function 11ex acts switch mapping input values 0 1 making suitable classification tasks,109,13,2.5086343,-13.863815,4,0.57423973,40
263,"we started the lecture by discussing a few questions from the previous class. sir showed us how we can find the standard error of the sample means just by using a single sample and then we discussed a few questions related to frequency distribution charts. the number of bins that need to be considered for correctly interpreting the â€˜goodnessâ€™ of the model depends on how we want to view the distribution. if we want a rough idea then we can use lesser number of bins. also we can use various formulae to find out the number of bins, depending on the size of the data. 
we then discussed some problems with fitting two different models to the same data. if we use two different models then it becomes difficult to find out which model we should use at the boundary. also, there maybe some discontinuity at the boundary and it may be difficult, in some cases to clearly define the boundary.
next we started with the topic of classification. we continued with the logistic regression model and studied about the sigmoid function. the sigmoid function returns a probability value, p which is the probability that the point belongs to a certain class. if the point is far away from the inflection point then it is clear which class it will belong to. but if it is close to the inflection point, then we can find the probabilities and depending on the probability values we classify the objects in different classes.
if p represents the probability of the object belonging to class 1 then if p > 0.5, we can say that the object belongs to class 1 otherwise it belongs to class 0.
our goal is to find the weights such that the difference between the predicted values and the true values is minimized.
if t is the actual value and p is the probability of t=1 then if t is actually 1 then we want p to be as close to 1 as possible. on the other hand, if t=0 then we want p to be as close to 0 as possible.
rather than maximizing any function we want to minimise it because maxima is unstable.
after fitting a model to the data, we can use a confusion matrix to assess the quality of the model.
we then discussed a few metrics related to classification. accuracy is one of the metrics that we discussed.
precision is yet another metric which is defined as the ratio of number of events correctly detected to the total number of events detected.
however accuracy can give us â€˜ false hopesâ€™. in situations wherein we have a large number of data points belonging to one class and a very few from the other then accuracy can be very high in such a situation because it is biased towards the data set with large number of points.
recall is defined as- how many events of a particular class you were able to detect correctly.
f value is the harmonic mean of recall and precision and it is better than accuracy and it doesn't give false hopes like accuracy. so it is a better metric to judge to goodness of the model.

349,"today's lecture covered the quality of classifiers, emphasizing that accuracy alone is not a reliable metric. instead, we should analyze precision, recall, and the roc curve to assess performance. precision (tp / (tp + fp)) and recall (tp / (tp + fn)) help measure how well a model predicts positive cases while minimizing false negatives.

we also discussed clustering, an unsupervised learning method where data is grouped without predefined labels. k-means clustering requires specifying the number of clusters, while hierarchical clustering determines clusters automatically based on data structure.

the confusion matrix was introduced to evaluate models using true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. accuracy is calculated as (tp + tn) / total samples. we also explored logistic regression and neural networks, highlighting their role in classification.

finally, the roc curve and auc were discussed. a higher auc (closer to 1) indicates a better classifier, while 0.5 suggests random performance. a poor classifier flattens the roc curve, reducing its ability to distinguish between classes. overall, the lecture focused on evaluating classifiers and clustering techniques effectively.",covered quality classifiers emphasizing accuracy alone reliable metric instead analyze precision recall roc curve assess performance precision tp tp fp recall tp tp fn help measure well model predicts positive cases minimizing false negatives also clustering unsupervised learning method grouped without predefined labels kmeans clustering requires specifying number clusters hierarchical clustering determines clusters automatically based structure confusion matrix introduced evaluate models using true positives true negatives false positives false negatives accuracy calculated tp tn total samples also explored logistic regression neural networks highlighting role classification finally roc curve auc higher auc closer 1 indicates classifier 05 suggests random performance poor classifier flattens roc curve reducing ability distinguish classes overall focused evaluating classifiers clustering techniques effectively,115,5,8.656109,-30.981646,5,0.8802299,1
305,"we started our discussion with the classification evaluation metrics. then, we visited a website to visualize different data distributions and their classification boundaries by adjusting nodes and features for a neural network. after that, we moved to the notebook for logistic regression, where we loaded the data and converted it into a dataframe. we analyzed the classification performance using different evaluation metrics, as accuracy alone is not sufficient to validate our model's performance. we also looked at other evaluation metrics such as the confusion matrix, f1 score, recall, and accuracy. 
next, we examined the roc curve, which shows how many false positives our classifier detects before identifying true positives. the area under the roc curve (auc-roc) indicates the quality of our classifier. if the auc-roc value is less than or equal to 0.5, the classifier performs no better than a random guess.
this was for binary classification. we then moved on to multiclass classifiers, where we examined the classification evaluation scores and the confusion matrix for each class. we also looked at the auc-roc curve for each class and compared the performance of our classifier across different classes.
we started discussing clustering methods, which are unsupervised machine learning techniques. first, we explored the hierarchical clustering method. we plotted a dendrogram to analyze the closeness of data points and determine how to divide them into clusters. then, we moved on to the k-means clustering method, where we discussed how k-means assigns data points to clusters.",started classification evaluation metrics visited website visualize different distributions classification boundaries adjusting nodes features neural network moved notebook logistic regression loaded converted dataframe analyzed classification performance using different evaluation metrics accuracy alone sufficient validate models performance also looked evaluation metrics confusion matrix f1 score recall accuracy next examined roc curve shows many false positives classifier detects identifying true positives area roc curve aucroc indicates quality classifier aucroc value less equal 05 classifier performs random guess binary classification moved multiclass classifiers examined classification evaluation scores confusion matrix class also looked aucroc curve class compared performance classifier across different classes started discussing clustering methods unsupervised machine learning techniques first explored hierarchical clustering method plotted dendrogram analyze closeness points determine divide clusters moved kmeans clustering method kmeans assigns points clusters,127,5,8.008573,-31.765318,5,0.86974007,2
264,"during this session, we explored key concepts in model evaluation and clustering techniques. we began with understanding the roc curve, a graphical tool for assessing classifier performance by plotting the true positive rate (tpr) against the false positive rate (fpr). tpr (or sensitivity/recall) is defined as the ratio of correctly classified positives to the total actual positives, while fpr is the ratio of negatives incorrectly classified as positive to the total actual negatives. by varying the decision threshold, different tpr and fpr values are obtained, which form the roc curve. a perfect classifier achieves an immediate vertical jump to (0,1) with an auc of 1.0, whereas a poor modelâ€™s roc curve follows the diagonal with an auc near 0.5.
additionally, the auc, which ranges from 0 to 1, summarizes model performance and assists in comparing models. however, limitations exist, especially with imbalanced datasets and the need for selecting a proper decision threshold.

we got to know about a tool ('neural network playground') , where we can vary the parameters and visualize the classification and regression with neural networks.

we also discussed converting regression problems into classification tasks by discretizing the continuous target variable. this method simplifies the problem by grouping continuous values into categories but involves trade-offs, including loss of detail. domain knowledge is essential for choosing proper bin thresholds.

then shifted focus to clustering methods. k-means clustering organizes data into groups based on similarity by assigning points to centroids and iteratively updating these centroids. hierarchical clustering, in contrast, builds a dendrogramâ€”a tree-like diagram that shows how clusters merge over various dissimilarity levels. the vertical height in the dendrogram represents the distance at which clusters merge. in particular, complete linkage defines cluster distance by the maximum distance between any pair of points, yielding compact, well-separated clusters.

76,today we continued discussing about logistic regression the class began with the  demonstration of artificial neural networks and we learnt that selecting appropriate and relevant number of features is very important. we then revisited the logistic regression metrices and a new metric was introduced today and that was roc graph which tells us that how many true positives did the model predict before predicting the false positives and for a good model which can make a boundary between two clusters then the area under the curve must be close to 1 if the data is not good and if there is too much overlap of the data then in such cases the area under the curve will be close to 0.5. we then saw two examples of logistic regression one showing how to interpret the metrices like accuracy. precision and confusion matrix. we looked at another example where there were four clusters in the data but one had class imbalance and we could clearly see in the roc curve that specific class had very low area under the curve. we looked at clustering methods mainly k-means and hierarchical clustering. the main difference between these two is that we have to specify  number of cluster we want in k-means but the hierarchical clustering considers every data point as a cluster and then starts making broader groups. k-means works on taking the n-means and then starts calculating the euclidean distance between other points which ever is close to the nth mean it is classified into that cluster. hierarchical clustering uses indivdual points as a cluster and then finds which element is close to it forms a bigger cluster with that now distance between this cluster and other cluster is calculated and which ever is smaller is taken in to form a bigger cluster,continued discussing logistic regression class began demonstration artificial neural networks selecting appropriate relevant number features important revisited logistic regression metrices new metric introduced roc graph tells us many true positives model predict predicting false positives good model make boundary two clusters area curve must close 1 good much overlap cases area curve close 05 saw two examples logistic regression one showing interpret metrices like accuracy precision confusion matrix looked another four clusters one class imbalance could clearly see roc curve specific class low area curve looked clustering methods mainly kmeans hierarchical clustering main difference two specify number cluster want kmeans hierarchical clustering considers every point cluster starts making broader groups kmeans works taking nmeans starts calculating euclidean distance points ever close nth mean classified cluster hierarchical clustering uses indivdual points cluster finds element close forms bigger cluster distance cluster cluster calculated ever smaller taken form bigger cluster,147,5,10.272076,-30.90023,5,0.83133554,10

diving into the coding aspect, we implemented logistic regression while emphasizing why metrics like the confusion matrix and roc curves offer deeper insights than simple accuracy scores. the roc curve emerged as a crucial tool for assessing classifiers, with an auc value close to 1 indicating strong performance. we also explored how adjusting classification thresholds impacts the roc curve and tackled the complexities of multi-class classification, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

shifting gears to unsupervised learning, the focus moved to clustering techniques. k-means, with its requirement to predefine the number of clusters, was explored alongside its iterative approach to grouping data points. in contrast, hierarchical clustering provided a more flexible alternative, generating a dendrogram to reveal cluster relationships and guide decisions on the optimal number of clusters.",logistic regression classification clustering took center stage todayâ€™s kicked error metrics confusion matrix highlighting significance evaluating model performance tensorflow playground provided interactive way explore classification problems visually reinforcing key concepts diving coding aspect implemented logistic regression emphasizing metrics like confusion matrix roc curves offer deeper insights simple accuracy scores roc curve emerged crucial tool assessing classifiers auc value close 1 indicating strong performance also explored adjusting classification thresholds impacts roc curve tackled complexities multiclass classification particularly dealing imbalanced datasets shifting gears unsupervised learning focus moved clustering techniques kmeans requirement predefine number clusters explored alongside iterative approach grouping points contrast hierarchical clustering provided flexible alternative generating dendrogram reveal cluster relationships guide decisions optimal number clusters,114,5,8.798969,-31.2736,5,0.8212137,12

220,"a confusion matrix is a fundamental tool for evaluating a classifier's performance, displaying the counts of true positives (tp), false positives (fp), true negatives (tn), and false negatives (fn). it helps compute key performance metrics such as precision (tp / (tp + fp)), which measures correctness among positive predictions, and recall (tp / (tp + fn)), indicating how well the model identifies actual positives. the f1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balances both metrics.

data imbalance, where one class significantly outnumbers others, can distort model performance, often requiring techniques like resampling (oversampling or undersampling) to balance the dataset.

in unsupervised learning, clustering is used to group similar data points. k-means clustering partitions data into k clusters using centroids, while hierarchical clustering builds a nested hierarchy of clusters based on similarity. these methods are widely used for segmentation, anomaly detection, and pattern discovery in large datasets. evaluating classifier quality and understanding clustering techniques are crucial in machine learning applications.",confusion matrix fundamental tool evaluating classifiers performance displaying counts true positives tp false positives fp true negatives tn false negatives fn helps compute key performance metrics precision tp tp fp measures correctness among positive predictions recall tp tp fn indicating well model identifies actual positives f1score harmonic mean precision recall balances metrics imbalance one class significantly outnumbers others distort model performance often requiring techniques like resampling oversampling undersampling balance dataset unsupervised learning clustering group similar points kmeans clustering partitions k clusters using centroids hierarchical clustering builds nested hierarchy clusters based similarity methods widely segmentation anomaly detection pattern discovery large datasets evaluating classifier quality understanding clustering techniques crucial machine learning applications,110,5,8.774129,-30.251163,5,0.78346115,21

the confusion matrix was explained, and the teacher showed a website to try neural network clustering.
after that, students looked at logistic regression code and learned about important measures like precision, recall, and the f1 score.
the roc curve was introduced, where the x-axis shows the false positive rate (fpr) and the y-axis shows the true positive rate (tpr).
it was also said that each class has its own roc curve.
next, the session moved to clustering, starting with k-means, where the number of groups is decided before.
in the end, the discussion moved to hierarchical clustering and different ways to do clustering were explained.

365,"we first revised a few concepts from the previous class. to assess the quality of any classification model, we use the confusion matrix. the confusion matrix gives us the number of points that are correctly identified and those that are incorrectly identified, in a tabulated manner. sir showed us some code for fitting a given data set with a logistic regression model and obtaining the various metrics associated with it. the â€˜scoreâ€™ represents the accuracy in a classification model, just like it represents r in regression. we also found out the true positive rate and the false positive rate. these are key metrics used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. true positive rate measures the fraction of the actual positives that are correctly determined by the model. similarly, false positives represent the proportion of actual negatives that are incorrectly classified as positive.
the receiver operating curve (roc) plots tpr vs fpr. if the curve is nearly vertical, then it means before classifying any points as â€˜false positivesâ€™, all the â€˜true positivesâ€™ have already been identified. on the other hand, if the line is exactly 45 degrees, it means the classification is completely random, or we can say that we are not using any classifier at all. so ideally, we want our plot to be as steep as possible. also, the area under the curve for a good classifier should be as close to 1 as possible. various points along the curve represent different threshold values. as you increase the threshold, the model becomes more stricter and hence, there are lesser chances of obtaining true positives, thereby increasing the false negatives. 
a good classifier is fine until there arenâ€™t any significant overlaps in the data sets. however, if the two sets have significantly high overlap, then no classifier will work well for it.
so, we can improve the quality of our classifier by either transforming the data or creating new and relevant features using feature engineering.
we also looked at yet another metric- â€˜supportâ€™. this represents the total number of observations that are in â€˜supportâ€™ of the class, i.e. the number of observations, that have been classified under that class by the model.
next, we started with â€˜clusteringâ€™. this is another unsupervised learning algorithm. in this, the points in a given data set are clustered and different groups are made among these. this is usually a part of eda and is used to assign labels to unlabeled data. there are two types of models in it- k means clustering and hierarchical clustering. 
in k- means clustering, we have to specify the number of â€˜meansâ€™ or in other words the number of clusters that we want. this is not the case for hierarchical clustering. 
in k- means clustering, all the points are randomly classified first and based on these, a mean value is obtained. using this mean value, the distance between a point and the means of various clusters is calculated and this is done for every point. the point is reassigned to a cluster, whose mean value is closest to the point. the new mean for a cluster is re- calculated based on the new points. then again, the points are reassigned into different clusters. this is repeatedly done, until we reach a step wherein there is no change in the arrangement of the points. this is our final clustering. 
if the initial assignment of the points to various clusters differs, we can get different clusters every time for the same data set. so, we run multiple such algorithms and the final cluster for a point is chosen to be that cluster in which it falls for the maximum number of times. 
hierarchical clustering algorithm considers every point as a cluster in itself, and starts clubbing all the clusters one by one, until it reaches a final single cluster with all the points. this is represented as a dendrogram. the height of the leg of the diagram represents the distance between the two points/clusters. so, hierarchical clustering gives many different clusters, which are combined and recombined to form larger and larger clusters. we can decide upto which point we want the clusters. thatâ€™s it for this class.

214,"in todayâ€™s class we visit a website named â€œplayground.tensorflow.orgâ€ in which we play among the number of layers or neurons and features to see what kind of classification does it do. next we see some codes related to logistic regression, we see that we canâ€™t rely on just score or accuracy of the model. we have to compare the elements of confusion matrices to see whether it is good model or not. in the code we see two new terms 1) true positive rate - it is calculated as tp / (tp + fn), where tp is the number of true positive and fn is the number of false negative instances.
2)false positive rate - it is calculated as fp/fp+tn, where fp is the number of false positives and tn is the number of true negatives.
next we learnt about the receiver operating characteristics curve (roc) - it tell us that when does the classifier start detecting incorrect false positive. it refers the quality of classifier. for a good classifier the curve should be straight, if the curve gets flatter then it meant that the classifier is randomly classifying without any mathematical function.
we would like a classifier that discriminates between the classes even if it is overlapping. the other part of roc curve is area under curve(auc), it should be close to 1 for a good classifier. if it is close to 0.5 then it is not a good classifier. next we see an example of an imbalanced datasets where we calculate precision, recall value for class 3. other than the precision and recall, support represents the number of actual occurrences of a class in a datasets. examples of imbalance datasets is fraudulent or scams. interesting things is that we can convert regression problem into classification problem by creating bins but vice versa is not possible as it cause data losses. we see the unsupervised method of classification which is â€œclusteringâ€. k-means and hierarchical clusterings are two which we discuss. in k-means we have to specify the number of clusters but in hierarchical clustering we donâ€™t have to specify such things. in hierarchical clustering every data points is assigned to its own unique cluster.",todayâ€™s class visit website named â€œplaygroundtensorfloworgâ€ play among number layers neurons features see kind classification next see codes related logistic regression see canâ€™t rely score accuracy model compare elements confusion matrices see whether good model code see two new terms 1 true positive rate calculated tp tp fn tp number true positive fn number false negative instances 2false positive rate calculated fpfptn fp number false positives tn number true negatives next receiver operating characteristics curve roc tell us classifier start detecting incorrect false positive refers quality classifier good classifier curve straight curve gets flatter meant classifier randomly classifying without mathematical function would like classifier discriminates classes even overlapping part roc curve area curveauc close 1 good classifier close 05 good classifier next see imbalanced datasets calculate precision recall value class 3 precision recall support represents number actual occurrences class datasets examples imbalance datasets fraudulent scams interesting things convert regression problem classification problem creating bins vice versa possible cause losses see unsupervised method classification â€œclusteringâ€ kmeans hierarchical clusterings two discuss kmeans specify number clusters hierarchical clustering donâ€™t specify things hierarchical clustering every points assigned unique cluster,185,5,4.7491407,-32.87785,5,0.77146286,24

135,"todayâ€™s session was a great mix of hands-on exploration and theory. we started by playing around with playground.tensorflow.org, tweaking the number of layers in a neural network to see how it affects performance. as we increased the degree of freedom, the model became more flexible and adapted better to the datasetâ€”until we pushed it too far and saw overfitting, where the model started memorizing patterns instead of generalizing them.

moving on to classification, we discussed the confusion matrix and broke down key terms like true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. we also saw how overlapping false positives and false negatives can make classification tricky. this naturally led us to the roc curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) and why the area under the curve (auc) matters. we learned that:

auc close to 1 means a great classifier.
auc around 0.5 (a straight diagonal line) means the model is no better than random guessing.
a key takeaway was that in real-life scenarios, data imbalance is a big challenge. for example, in fraud detection, fraudulent transactions are rare compared to normal ones, so the model often fails to detect them. thatâ€™s why accuracy alone isnâ€™t a reliable metric, and we should focus on precision, recall, and the confusion matrix instead.

shifting gears, we explored unsupervised learning and looked at k-means clusteringâ€”how data points are randomly assigned to clusters, centroids are calculated, and points are re-grouped iteratively. we also got introduced to hierarchical clustering and dendrograms, where we focused on complete linkage as a clustering method.

to wrap things up, we saw a python implementation that plotted roc curves, helping us visualize how well a classifier performs.

232,"the lecture continued on the lines of logistic regression and classification ideas, from where we left off. we started off by discussing the error metrics and the confusion matrix. then we were given a demonstration on some sample data on â€˜playground.tensorflow.orgâ€™, which allowed us to play around with data and neural networks. it allowed us to add features to our classification problem. then we moved on to some code for logistic regression. we understood that the score function for a logistic regression model library gives us the accuracy, which we should not believe. we also plotted the confusion matrix for the data, and understood the true positives and true negatives. we then studied the reciever operating characteristics (roc) curve. the roc curve rose vertically at the start and then became horizontal. this should us that for the given dataset, our model first detected all the true positives before starting to detect false positives. ideally, the roc curve is usually shaped in a crescent shape. the roc curve indicates the quality of the classifier, where a sharper roc curve indicates a better model. the logistic_regression function returns the predicted class for an observation, or the probability value associated with it. hence, by changing the threshold between the classes, we can change the quality of the model and check it using the roc curve. the 45 degree line on the roc curve tells us that there is no classification between the points. hence, the flatter the roc curve for our classifier, the worse is our classification model. we also measure the area under the roc curve and call it as auc. for a good classifier, this value is close to 1. the worst classifier is the one with the roc curve the same as the 45 degrees line. hence the worst case auc value is 0.5. the points on the roc curve correspond to different threshold values for the classification. 
we then moved on to data having more than 2 classes, and we realised that sometimes, due to lack of anomalous data, we might not be able to use our classifier. in the entire system of the classifier, some classes may have very low f1-score, which means that they are under-represented and the classifier canâ€™t be relied on for classification of data into that class. each class has itâ€™s own roc curve, and hence a classifier can be good for one class, while being equally bad for another, which can be seen using the roc curve of that class for our classifier. 
then we moved on to clustering, which was a part of unsupervised learning. in this case, our data does not have any labels, and we need to assign labels to the data ourselves based on some characteristics. this assignment becomes a part of eda. we then studied about some clustering algorithms like hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. for k-means clustering, we need to give the number of clusters as the input, which is difficult to find out just based on visualisation of data. however, in hierarchical clustering, we plot a dendogram and then based on that, we can decide the number of clusters we need. 
in k-means clustering, we first specify the number of desired clusters. then the algorithm starts randomly assigning points to any cluster, and then we find the centroid of each cluster. then we find the distance of each point in a cluster to the centroid of all the clusters. then we reassign each point based on the centroid they are closest to. this process repeats until each point is closest to the centroid of its cluster than any other cluster. it is an o(n^2) algorithm. in this algorithm, the initial assignment also changes our final results. hence, we run the algorithm multiple times and check that for each point, which set was it clustered into multiple times, and hence we decide the final cluster it belongs to. 
hierarchical clustering does not require any initial cluster number. it results in a dendogram, which can help us decide our degree of clustering. it starts by assigning each point as a different cluster. it then gets grouped with other clusters and we get the dendogram. the number of clusters can be decided by where we observe the dendogram. the pair wise distance between each pair of clusters is calculated, and those clusters are grouped, whose distance is less than all the other pairwise distances of those clusters. this goes on till we have just one cluster, giving us the dendogram, and the number of clusters is decided by where we cut the graph.

93,"in the lecture, we began by exploring a website called playground.tensorflow.org, which allows users to interactively experiment with machine learning models. on this site, we could select a dataset, choose features, and configure the number and size of hidden layers in the neural network. by pressing the ""run"" button, we could start training the model and observe how each neuron affects the final classification. this provided a clear visual understanding of machine learning processes and helped us build an intuition for model behavior. an interesting point was that even with a single hidden layer and appropriate features, we were able to achieve high classification accuracy on challenging datasets.

next, we discussed logistic regression. in the example code, we didn't implement a train-test split, which is something we should always do to evaluate the model's performance more reliably. we used python's logistic regression library to train the model and evaluated it using the `score` function, which in the case of logistic regression refers to the modelâ€™s accuracy, unlike in linear regression, where it corresponds to the r-squared value. 

we also covered the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve, which is a graphical representation of a model's performance. the roc curve plots the true positive rate (tpr) against the false positive rate (fpr). a good classifier will classify most examples correctly before starting to make mistakes, which results in a steep increase in tpr with a minimal increase in fpr. we explained that for two classes, we can assume 2d gaussian distributions, each with different means. when the distributions are well separated, the overlap is minimal, leading to fewer misclassifications. however, when the distributions are less well separated, thereâ€™s more overlap, increasing the chance of classification errors. the model calculates the probability of each classification, and by adjusting the threshold, we can compute different tpr and fpr values, which form the roc curve. if the area under the roc curve is 1, the classifier is considered perfect.

following this, we explored multiclass classification. in this case, we calculated the precision, recall, and f1 score for each class. if one of the classes showed particularly low precision, recall, or f1 score, it suggested that the dataset was imbalanced, with too few instances of that class. we also generated multiple roc curves, one for each class, to evaluate the performance across all categories.

the lecture then shifted to clustering, a form of unsupervised learning where we only have feature data (x) and no target variable (y). we learned about key clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, and the importance of clustering metrics to evaluate how well the data points are grouped.

in k-means clustering, the number of clusters, k, must be specified beforehand. the algorithm starts by randomly selecting k initial cluster centers. each data point is then assigned to the nearest center, forming the initial clusters. the centers are recalculated as the mean of the points in each cluster, and the process repeats iteratively until the cluster centers no longer change, indicating convergence.

hierarchical clustering, on the other hand, does not require predefining the number of clusters. instead, it focuses on the distance between clusters using a method called linkage. there are several types of linkage, such as single, complete, average, and wardâ€™s method, which define how the distance between clusters is measured. in hierarchical clustering, the process begins with each data point as its own individual cluster. the two clusters with the smallest distance between them are merged, and this process continues iteratively. eventually, all the points are combined into a single cluster. a key feature of hierarchical clustering is that it can be represented visually through a dendrogram, a tree-like diagram that shows the sequence of merges. by cutting the dendrogram at different levels, we can obtain different numbers of clusters and visually inspect how the data points are grouped. this gives us the flexibility to explore clusters at various levels of granularity.

during this session, we reviewed several techniques used to transform categorical data into numeric representations, which is an essential step in getting data ready for machine learning models. the discussion began with the introduction to feature encoding techniques such as vectorization techniques and utilization of one-hot encoding, label encoding, integer encoding, binary encoding, frequency encoding, and target encoding.

one-hot encoding:
one-hot encoding converts categorical features into vector where each category has a separate column. one-hot encoding is particularly helpful when encoding the input features (x) in the case of multiclass or multilabel problems. one-hot encoding is less ideal for encoding target variables (y). one of the primary disadvantages of one-hot encoding is that it can cause the curse of dimensionality. for example, if you have a variable such as pincode with thousands of distinct values, applying one-hot encoding will lead to a dimensionality explosion, making the dataset sparse and computationally intensive.

label encoding vs. integer encoding:
label encoding gives each category a specific integer. the method is well-suited to encoding target variables (y), especially for classification tasks, but may not be suitable for input features where the model may mistake the numerical ordering as an ordinal relationship. on the other hand, integer encoding is used when the target variable is naturally ordinal instead of nominal, such that the order of the categories holds important meaning.

binary encoding:-
binary encoding, or pseudo one-hot encoding, offers a more compact representation compared to one-hot encoding. by converting categorical values into binary code, a few columns (for example, three columns) can represent multiple classes (up to eight classes in this example). this method helps mitigate the issue of high dimensionality while preserving the distinctiveness of each category.

frequency encoding:
frequency encoding substitutes each class with its frequency in the dataset. while it reduces the representation, it is not necessarily good for target variables because two classes can have the same frequencies, causing possible loss of useful information.

target encoding:
target encoding allocates to each category the target variable's mean for that category. target encoding can be especially useful when there is high correlation between the target variable and the categorical feature. however, caution needs to be exercised to prevent data leakage while training the model.

simplification strategies:
tackling complicated regression questions by converting them into classification questions using methods such as feature binning is common. also introduced briefly was converting text into numeric vectors through vectorization methods as a key step in handling unstructured data.

in general, the suitable encoding method is determined by the type of data, if the variable is utilized as a feature or target, and possibly the effect it may have on dimensionality. every approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and the proper choice is critical to constructing efficient and effective machine learning models.",feature encoding techniques reviewed several techniques transform categorical numeric representations essential step getting ready machine learning models began introduction feature encoding techniques vectorization techniques utilization onehot encoding label encoding integer encoding binary encoding frequency encoding target encoding onehot encoding onehot encoding converts categorical features vector category separate column onehot encoding particularly helpful encoding input features x case multiclass multilabel problems onehot encoding less ideal encoding target variables one primary disadvantages onehot encoding cause curse dimensionality variable pincode thousands distinct values applying onehot encoding lead dimensionality explosion making dataset sparse computationally intensive label encoding vs integer encoding label encoding gives category specific integer method wellsuited encoding target variables especially classification tasks may suitable input features model may mistake numerical ordering ordinal relationship hand integer encoding target variable naturally ordinal instead nominal order categories holds important meaning binary encoding binary encoding pseudo onehot encoding offers compact representation compared onehot encoding converting categorical values binary code columns three columns represent multiple classes eight classes method helps mitigate issue high dimensionality preserving distinctiveness category frequency encoding frequency encoding substitutes class frequency dataset reduces representation necessarily good target variables two classes frequencies causing possible loss useful information target encoding target encoding allocates category target variables mean category target encoding especially useful high correlation target variable categorical feature however caution needs exercised prevent leakage training model simplification strategies tackling complicated regression questions converting classification questions using methods feature binning common also introduced briefly converting text numeric vectors vectorization methods key step handling unstructured general suitable encoding method determined type variable utilized feature target possibly effect may dimensionality every approach strengths weaknesses proper choice critical constructing efficient effective machine learning models,274,6,32.646896,-3.0281231,6,0.89952725,1
63,"in todayâ€™s class, we covered different techniques for encoding categorical data. we started with feature encoding, where we learned about one-hot encoding and vectorization. one-hot encoding is useful for categorical data, but it can lead to the curse of dimensionality when the number of unique categories is very large. vectorization, on the other hand, helps convert text data into numerical form, which we only touched on briefly toward the end of the lecture.  

we also explored label encoding, which assigns a unique integer to each category. however, if the labels have a natural order (making them ordinal rather than nominal), using integer encoding would be more meaningful. for multiclass and multilabel problems, different encoding approaches may be required depending on the complexity of the data.  

binary encoding was another method we discussed, where each category is converted into a binary format, which helps reduce dimensionality â€” for example, three binary columns can represent up to eight classes. we also learned about frequency encoding, where the frequency of a category is used as its encoded value, and target encoding, where the encoding is based on the relationship between the category and the target variable.  

overall, the session introduced us to the challenges and trade-offs involved in different encoding methods and gave us a basic idea of how to handle text data through vectorization.",todayâ€™s class covered different techniques encoding categorical started feature encoding learned onehot encoding vectorization onehot encoding useful categorical lead curse dimensionality number unique categories large vectorization hand helps convert text numerical form touched briefly toward end also explored label encoding assigns unique integer category however labels natural order making ordinal rather nominal using integer encoding would meaningful multiclass multilabel problems different encoding approaches may required depending complexity binary encoding another method category converted binary format helps reduce dimensionality â€” three binary columns represent eight classes also learned frequency encoding frequency category encoded value target encoding encoding based relationship category target variable overall introduced us challenges tradeoffs involved different encoding methods gave us basic idea handle text vectorization,117,6,32.654842,-4.5182776,6,0.89398485,2
2,"in this session, we explored various feature encoding techniques, essential for converting categorical and textual data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models. initially, we discussed vectorization and one-hot encoding. vectorization is a general approach to transform textual or categorical data into numerical vectors. one-hot encoding specifically converts categorical variables into binary vectors, creating separate columns for each category. this method is widely used in multiclass and multilabel classification problems but can introduce the curse of dimensionality when dealing with variables having many unique categories.

we then examined label encoding and integer encoding. label encoding assigns each categorical class a unique integer value. while this method is straightforward, it implies an ordinal relationship between categories, which may not always be appropriate. integer encoding is particularly useful when the categorical variable represents ordinal data (categories with a meaningful order), as it preserves the inherent ordering.

due to the limitations of one-hot encoding, such as increased dimensionality, we introduced binary encoding (compact encoding). binary encoding efficiently represents multiple categories using fewer columnsâ€”for example, just three columns can encode up to eight distinct classes. this approach helps mitigate dimensionality issues while retaining meaningful category distinctions.

additionally, we covered frequency encoding and target encoding. frequency encoding involves assigning each category a numerical value based on its frequency within the dataset. target encoding replaces categories with values derived from the target variable (such as the mean target value for each category), effectively capturing relationships between categories and the outcome variable.

finally, we briefly touched upon methods for converting textual data into numerical vectors through vectorization techniques, setting the stage for deeper exploration in future sessions.

338,"todayâ€™s lecture started off with the birdâ€™s eye view of the next one month, and we briefly discussed about the project. we then started off by discussing about feature encoding. both the independent or dependent variables might need to be encoded in order to convert them into numerical forms for training the ml models. basic feature encoding includes one-hot encoding, which involves vectorisation i.e. creating vectors of the size equal to the number of classes and then assigning 1 to one of the vector components based on the class. we then talked about different types of encoding like label encoding, which involves taking all possible values of the categorical variable and assigning integers to them sequentially. this kind of encoding works for the dependent variable, but not for the independent variable as the independent variable defines the model and hence any kind of ordering or hierarchy in its values will lead to errors. integer encoding has an inherent sense of order, where the assigned values may not be sequential and may have some meaning. one hot encoding has an issue that it increases the number of columns, and thus invites the curse of dimensionality. hence, one hot encoding should be used carefully and with data having lesser number of categories. we also discussed binary encoding, which uses bits for encoding. frequency encoding involves assigning the frequency of a class as its encoded value. this method is not very useful for the dependent variable as we need unique values for categorising y, whereas frequency encoding may lead to assigning same values if the frequency of two classes is the same.  we also have target encoding, where the average of the y values for a given class, are assigned to all the class values in the data columns. we then moved on to problems where we want to convert continuous data into discrete data such as height, weight, etc. in such cases, we might be moving on from regression to classification, which could lead to improvement in our metrics. we then talked about text processing, where we discussed large language models, which are examples of the manner in which statistical processing can generate a deterministic output. text processing basically involves converting text to numbers so that processing is efficient. usually the methodology includes dropping some very common words called stop words, which do not add to the meaning of the sentence. we then create a dictionary of words and then express the document using the dictionary.

255,"in today's lecture, the discussion was on feature engineering and encoding. depending upon the type of measurement (nominal/ordinal/interval/ratio) the inputs has to concerted into appropriate numbers that machine can understand (i.e., there is a need for encoding). we learnt different types of encoding methods. 
one-hot encoding: this splits the main dependent variable y into more than one variable which are independent of each other. but this method invites the curse of dimensionality (as it explodes into many number of columns) and gets into trouble in case of multiclass problem & multilabel problem; and hence should be used only in case of nominal data with less number of columns. 
after that sir explained label encoding and integer encoding. in integer encoding when we want to categorise things based on integers, there is an inherit sense of ordering where as in case of label encoding, numbers only represents different categories, it does not mean any kind of ordering. 
then sir explained binary encoding: binary encoding also accounts for combination of variables like (1,1,0) etc. unlike one-hot encoding where such combination tend to create (multilabel) problems. frequency encoding and target encoding were also explained along with this methods.
at last, sir explained feature binning, when we have low value of râ² (all the variance is not possibly explained by the regression model), in such cases me form bins and create classification model on them,  thus even if the regression model fails to predict the values effectively,  classification model works well in this case with high accuracy, precision,  recall, and f1 scores. towards the end of the lecture, we had and short introduction about how to process text data. how we can store it (use a number for each word or use an array to store that number; how the meaning of word can change with respect to its surrounding, etc. and how yo process text considering all this things).",feature engineering encoding depending upon type measurement nominalordinalintervalratio inputs concerted appropriate numbers machine understand ie need encoding different types encoding methods onehot encoding splits main dependent variable one variable independent method invites curse dimensionality explodes many number columns gets trouble case multiclass problem multilabel problem hence case nominal less number columns sir explained label encoding integer encoding integer encoding want categorise things based integers inherit sense ordering case label encoding numbers represents different categories mean kind ordering sir explained binary encoding binary encoding also accounts combination variables like 110 etc unlike onehot encoding combination tend create multilabel problems frequency encoding target encoding also explained along methods last sir explained feature binning low value râ² variance possibly explained regression model cases form bins create classification model thus even regression model fails predict values effectively classification model works well case high accuracy precision recall f1 scores towards end short introduction process text store use number word use array store number meaning word change respect surrounding etc yo process text considering things,169,6,33.181664,-4.711425,6,0.8693553,5
71,"in today's session, we first discuss what we are going to cover next in the course, including feature engineering, data engineering, data preparation, big data, cloud computing, and tools in the cloud, etc. we further discussed the upcoming project and exercises. then we discussed the feature encoding irrespective of the kind of dependence of y, whether it is dependent on categorical variables, they must be converted to a numerical value. there are 6 types of encoding as follows:
label encoding: we assign a unique integer to each category, like red:0, blue:1, or green:2, but these already assign an ordinal relationship in the data, and we should apply this to y rather than x. 
one-hot encoding: converting categories into vectors like red:(1,0,0), blue:(0,1,0), and green:(0,0,1), but here we increase the dimensionality in the data. 
binary encoding: converts the categorical values into separate binary columns as a:00, b:01, c:10, d:11, this is similar to pseudo one-hot encoding, but here we reduce the dimensionality comparatively, still has various columns. 
integer encoding: somewhat similar to label but used in tree-based models mainly. frequency encoding: assigning the frequency of the categorical variable in the dataset. target encoding: replaces categories with the mean of the target variable for each category. 
for the y=f(x) we simply use one-hot encoding for the x-side and the y-side, consider everything, one or multiple labels based on the problem, and apply appropriate models. we further learn about feature binning, where we change continuous numerical features into categorical features and then use the classification model. at last, we see about llm in which statistical processing can generate deterministic output and we will mainly use it for code generation.

todayâ€™s class began with a revision of the t-sne plot. then, we moved on to feature engineering, starting with feature encoding, which is essential when either dependent or independent variables are categorical. these variables must be encoded before being used in a machine learning model.  

we first discussed one-hot encodingwith an example where the dependent variable was categorical, while three features were numerical, and one was categorical (e.g., ""blue""). we then covered multiclass and multilabel problems and discussed the drawback of one-hot encodingâ€”it increases the number of columns, leading to the curse of dimensionality and making the dataset sparse.  

for nominal data, one-hot encoding can be used if the number of classes is small. however, for ordinal data, assigning specific weights to categories is necessary, so one-hot encoding is not recommended.  

next, we explored binary encoding, where categorical values are first converted into numerical values and then expressed in binary notation. we also covered frequency encoding and target encoding as alternative methods.  

towards the end, we started discussing llms (large language models)and how words are converted into numerical data or vectors for processing in machine learning models.",todayâ€™s class began revision tsne plot moved feature engineering starting feature encoding essential either dependent independent variables categorical variables must encoded machine learning model first onehot encodingwith dependent variable categorical three features numerical one categorical eg blue covered multiclass multilabel problems drawback onehot encodingâ€”it increases number columns leading curse dimensionality making dataset sparse nominal onehot encoding number classes small however ordinal assigning specific weights categories necessary onehot encoding recommended next explored binary encoding categorical values first converted numerical values expressed binary notation also covered frequency encoding target encoding alternative methods towards end started discussing llms large language modelsand words converted numerical vectors processing machine learning models,106,6,31.619987,-2.8331065,6,0.8640635,9

the discussion then moved to different encoding techniques for categorical data. label encoding assigns numerical values to categorical variables and can be used for both dependent (y) and independent (x) variables. one-hot encoding, another common method, creates binary columns for each category but can significantly increase dimensionality. binary encoding provides an alternative by converting categories into binary format and mapping them to new columns, thereby reducing dimensionality compared to one-hot encoding. additionally, frequency encoding was discussed, where categorical values are replaced by their occurrence count in the dataset. target encoding was also covered, which involves replacing categorical values with the mean of the target variable for each category. the session emphasized the importance of selecting appropriate encoding techniques based on the problem at hand, as different approaches impact model performance and interpretability in various ways.",focused feature engineering techniques particularly feature binning encoding methods machine learning feature binning technique converts continuous numerical features categorical features making useful classification models grouping values bins help improve model interpretability performance moved different encoding techniques categorical label encoding assigns numerical values categorical variables dependent independent x variables onehot encoding another common method creates binary columns category significantly increase dimensionality binary encoding provides alternative converting categories binary format mapping new columns thereby reducing dimensionality compared onehot encoding additionally frequency encoding categorical values replaced occurrence count dataset target encoding also covered involves replacing categorical values mean target variable category emphasized importance selecting appropriate encoding techniques based problem hand different approaches impact model performance interpretability ways,114,6,33.478157,-2.6397114,6,0.8598237,10
231,"feature encoding. when either the dependent variable or some of the independent variables are categorical then, they have to be appropriately encoded prior to being used for training ml models. the project will be related to assessment of exercises which we have done. label encoding, one hot encoding, binary encoding, integer encoding, frequency encoding, target encoding. multiclass problem- mnist dataset- there are 10 classes(0-9), multilabel problem- there are multiple labels associated with a single object, a image with both cat and dog. how we encode a variable depends on domain knowledge. label encoding- take categorical variables and assign numerical values to these values-this for nominal variable. we can use label encoding to encode output variable, but we should avoid using it on input variable. integer encoding is for ordinal variable- the numbers carry a value and have a meaning. one hot encoding- converting the output into a vector of dimension of number of classes. this increases the number of columns in data and introduces the curse of dimensionality. they choice of encoding depends on number of classes. one hot encoding can be used for nominal variables and classes are not too many. binary encoding- it is just a different notation of one hot encoding. we are converting vectors in one hot encoding into binary values(pseudo one hot encoding).  frequency encoding- the category values are replaced with its frequency in the column. class takes on value of occurance we have to check whether two classes have same frequency. target encoding- we collect all y values corresponding to a particular class take their average and use this to represnt x in input. this is used to encode the input variables. for encoding input variables, we can use one hot encoding generally. for output variable encoding we can use other techniques. eda is important as if we are not able to capture what data is properly we will not be able to perform the further processes correctly.  we need to think multiple times before applying a particular encoding. feature binning- many times we want to convert a continous problem to a discrete problem. we will divide the continous variable into bins and then assign categories to this. this now becomes a classification problem. it can be used for several reasons including problem simplification, reducing the impact of outliers and noise in the data, handling non linear relationships. how to process text data- natural language processing(nlp)- examples of the manner in which statistical processing can generate deterministic output- code generation. how to convert text into numbers so that analysis is useful. method1- drop the common words(stop words); convert to lower case. - create a dictionary. -express the document using the dictionary. in a sentence we cant know exact meaning until we know the context in which it is being used as each word might have multiple uses.

one hot encoding method creates columns which are equal to the number of unique categorical labels in the original data and fills each of these columns with respective true(1) and false(0)  values. this method should be used very cautiously as it increases the dimensionality of the data significantly and becomes cumbersome to work with. for one hot encoding treated data, the classification models should be tree based or neural network based as logistic regression cannot handle such data. to overcome the curse of dimensionality of one hot encoding we can follow another method which is similar to onh but uses bits instead of true or false values to encode the categories for example for categories of weather related data like hot, very hot the encodings can be 001 and 011 respectively. other most widely used data encoding method is label encoding in this integers are allotted to different categories present in the columns this is best suited for nominal scale entries of the columns as in this method there is no ordering of the integer values that is for example red:1 and blue:2 does not mean that blue is greater than red and its also important to note that this method works well for y and using this method for encoding x features must be avoided. integer encoding is another type of encoding which is very similar to label encoding but the only difference is the integer values have a sense of ordering and thus is suitable for ordinal scale valued columns. frequency encoding uses the number of occurrences of  particular category in a column and sets as the label for that particular category should only be used for features and not target variables, because there might be possible that two different categories might have same frequency but this issue some how doesn't affect the feature variables and thus can be used. target encoding this also used for encoding the feature variables where for a particular category all the corresponding y values are noted and then average of these noted values is set as the category label. we then discussed feature binning where the features with continuous values in discretised by making bins or categories so that the regression problem can be converted into classification problem , such conversion might be very useful when the actual data variance is very high and the r squared value of the regression model is very low. began discussion about processing text and how the text data is converted into numerical data which can be used to do some useful analysis. the common stop words are removed and dictionary of all the other words is made and a vector is associated to each sentence of the document based on whether the given word from the dictionary made is present in that particular sentence or not.",started feature encoding methods either dependent independent variables categorical use feature encoding techniques convert numerical forms work one hot encoding method creates columns equal number unique categorical labels original fills columns respective true1 false0 values method cautiously increases dimensionality significantly becomes cumbersome work one hot encoding treated classification models tree based neural network based logistic regression cannot handle overcome curse dimensionality one hot encoding follow another method similar onh uses bits instead true false values encode categories categories weather related like hot hot encodings 001 011 respectively widely encoding method label encoding integers allotted different categories present columns best suited nominal scale entries columns method ordering integer values red1 blue2 mean blue greater red also important note method works well using method encoding x features must avoided integer encoding another type encoding similar label encoding difference integer values sense ordering thus suitable ordinal scale valued columns frequency encoding uses number occurrences particular category column sets label particular category features target variables might possible two different categories might frequency issue doesnt affect feature variables thus target encoding also encoding feature variables particular category corresponding values noted average noted values set category label feature binning features continuous values discretised making bins categories regression problem converted classification problem conversion might useful actual variance high r squared value regression model low began processing text text converted numerical useful analysis common stop words removed dictionary words made vector associated sentence document based whether given word dictionary made present particular sentence,245,6,32.773285,-2.5143497,6,0.8181628,21

598,"this lecture was mostly based on feature encoding. feature encoding is done when the dependent or independent variables in your data is categorical. you need to convert this categorical data type to numerical so that it can be processed by the computer. there are different ways by which this can be done. we can expect two types of output through this. one is that there are multiple classes, out of which there is only one class which the y represents at a time. this is known as â€˜multiclass problemâ€™. another is the one in which two or more labels can be present in a single y value. this is known as â€˜multilabel problemâ€™. for example of multiclass problems, we can consider a situation in which the y value is some color. so, the color can be any of the decided number of color options. we can use label encoding for this type of problem. it just assigns labels to each of the possible options (in this case, the colors). these labels donâ€™t have any inherent value, they just represent the different classes. 
for multilabel problems, we can consider the situation in which the y value is an image which consists of both dog and cat. so, here for single y we can associate it with two different labels, cat and the dog.
for such data sets where y values are nominal, we use label encoding. 
but, if the y values have ordinal level of measurement, then we can use integer encoding. it assigns integer values to each of the class and these integer values also have inherent value associated with them, by which we can compare between two distinct values. 
the other types of encoding methods include:
1)	one- hot encoding: in this, we assign values of 1s and 0s to all the available classes. we basically create vectors, whose components can be either 1 or 0, depending on the actual class. so, for one feature, we create n different columns. â€˜nâ€™ depends on the number of classes associated with that feature. this increases the dimensionality. so, it shouldnâ€™t be used when there are large number of classes associated with a feature.
2)	binary encoding: it is also known as â€˜pseudo one-hot encodingâ€™. instead of using separate column for each class and unnecessarily increasing the dimensionality, we can reduce the number of columns used by using a combination of 1s and 0s to represent the different classes, instead of using just one column with 1 for each class.
3)	frequency encoding: in this type of encoding, the value associated with each class is just equal to its frequency in the data. this is generally not used for y variable as it may happen that two different classes in y have the same frequency. so, in this case, we wonâ€™t get â€˜distinctâ€™ label for each class.
4)	target encoding: in this, the value for each class is just the average of the corresponding y values associated with all the occurrences of that class.
5)	feature binning: in this, the numerical values are categorized (divided into categories) to turn the problem into a classification problem.
next, we just discussed a bit on how we can process text data. all the above techniques were used when the features were already known to us. but in case of text data, we donâ€™t have the features, we need to create them.
also, we need to convert a word to some numerical value, so that the computer can deal with it. a problem which can be encountered here is that one word can have multiple meanings in english language. so, we should be very careful while determining the meaning of a statement. the context of the statement should be clear before making any kind of predictions.

binary encoding, which produces a more condensed form, was the next topic we discussed.  we looked at how to determine the final product and the conversion process step-by-step.  with the introduction of frequency encoding, category values are swapped out for the frequency with which they occur in the dataset.  target encoding substitutes the average score over a predetermined threshold for data in a column.

146,"in this session, we covered key concepts related to dimensionality reduction, categorical data encoding, and classification modeling techniques.

we began with t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), which is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data. however, since t-sne is stochastic in nature, it produces different clusters each time it runs, making it unsuitable for building predictive models. in contrast, pca (principal component analysis) can be used for dimensionality reduction but is more suited for continuous numerical data rather than categorical data.

moving on to categorical data encoding, we discussed one-hot encoding, which converts categorical variables into binary vectors. for example, if a variable y belongs to categories red, blue, and green, one-hot encoding would represent them as:
red â†’ 100
blue â†’ 010
green â†’ 001
while one-hot encoding ensures that categorical variables are properly represented, it significantly increases the number of columns, leading to the curse of dimensionality, especially when dealing with high-cardinality categorical features. this can make models computationally expensive and difficult to train.

we then examined different types of classification problems:

multi-class classification, where the output belongs to one of many classes (e.g., classifying an image as either a cat, dog, or bird).
multi-label classification, where the output can belong to multiple categories simultaneously (e.g., tagging an image with labels like ""outdoor,"" ""sunny,"" and ""people"").
since one-hot encoding can sometimes be inefficient, we discussed alternative encoding techniques, such as:

binary encoding: a more compact representation for categorical variables.
frequency encoding: uses the count of each category's occurrences but is applied only to input variables (x), not the target variable (y).
target encoding (mean encoding): uses the average value of y for each category to encode the variable. this method is useful but may introduce data leakage if not handled properly.
lastly, we explored feature binning, a technique used when continuous features need to be converted into categorical variables. once transformed, the problem can be approached using a classification model instead of a regression model.",covered key concepts related dimensionality reduction categorical encoding classification modeling techniques began tsne tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding widely visualizing highdimensional however since tsne stochastic nature produces different clusters time runs making unsuitable building predictive models contrast pca principal component analysis dimensionality reduction suited continuous numerical rather categorical moving categorical encoding onehot encoding converts categorical variables binary vectors variable belongs categories red blue green onehot encoding would represent red â†’ 100 blue â†’ 010 green â†’ 001 onehot encoding ensures categorical variables properly represented significantly increases number columns leading curse dimensionality especially dealing highcardinality categorical features make models computationally expensive difficult train examined different types classification problems multiclass classification output belongs one many classes eg classifying image either cat dog bird multilabel classification output belong multiple categories simultaneously eg tagging image labels like outdoor sunny people since onehot encoding sometimes inefficient alternative encoding techniques binary encoding compact representation categorical variables frequency encoding uses count categorys occurrences applied input variables x target variable target encoding mean encoding uses average value category encode variable method useful may introduce leakage handled properly lastly explored feature binning technique continuous features need converted categorical variables transformed problem approached using classification model instead regression model,198,6,31.271803,-1.7647698,6,0.73798394,30

596,"the class started with the recall of t-sne algorithm. though we can create clusters but we should not create prediction models based on this. because t-sne converts n-dimensional data into two  dimensional and then form clusters on top of it. 
sir, then discussed about the project and we started a new topic: feature encoding.  
when y is categorical and some of x is categorical, they need to be encoded prior to training model. we need the values to be numerical and not categorical. one way to encode is vectorize (one hot encoding). if y has three values red, blue, green then we have y1, y2, y3 and assign 0 and 1 depending on the value of y. it works like y1 = f(x), y2 = f(x) and y3 = f(x). if we use logistic regression, then we predict three models. but the problem with this is that the three models are independent of each other. the main problems that arise are: multiclass problem, multilabel problem. 
when dealing with multilabel problem: expected outcome is one class out of many class. when dealing with multilabel problem: expected outcome is the total labels that are possible. the way in which we encode y is different for both the problems. in multiclass we encode with differential ways, like 0, 1, 2â€¦, in multilabel problem we encode such that values depend on one another. 
when we are working in multiclass problem and the dependent variable is categorical, we go with label encoding. giving numerical values to data. we should not do this for x, only y should be encoded in this since. another way is integer encoding: it has inherent sense of hierarchy. 
one- hot encoding has the problem that it brings more dimensions. example: when we are dealing with pin-codes. when we have nominal data we can use one hot encoding. we do not use one hot encoding for ordinal data. 
we then move to binary encoding. this is similar to one-hot encoding except there are more options to describe data. 
then we have frequency encoding. it uses the frequency measure as the encoding. we do not use this encoding for y, because we need distinct values for y. it can happen that two different y values get in same frequency. in target encoding, the values are replaced by the average value. 
then we looked at feature binning. it is used when continuous features need to be converted into categorical features. 

then we started: how to process text data? 
most llm are the examples of the manner in which statistical processing can generate deterministic output (code generation). the basic question is: how to convert text to numbers so that processing can be made efficient.

further ahead we have learnt about 4 levels of measurement -
1) nominal - it have discrete values and we can only categorize them. also there is no ordering between them. example - gender, color
2) ordinal - it also have discrete values and work same as nominal level of measurement. example - grades
3) interval - it have continuous value. the concept of 0 is arbitrary in this case. example  temperature
4) ratio - it also have continuous value. in this measurement 0 has a meaning. example - height, weight, salary
 in case of nominal and ordinal we use one-hot encoding to change words into numbers by making vector.
we learned that in y =f(x) where y is the label and x is called features.

- the data available is visualised and the crux is techinques to predict a function as close to the original functions
2. introduction to levels of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)
-nominal mainly represents equality i.e. equal or not equal.
-ordinal represents inequalities (<= or >=) with both being discrete
-interval represents a continuous data where reference i.e. 0 is not defined ex: temperature,   year
-ratio represents a continuous data type where a reference is defined i.e. ratio is defined.

ordinal: discrete data like grades, which have their inherent order, we can also classify them.
interval: continuous data like temperature, here the definition of 0 is arbitrary.
ratio: continuous data like height, in which you can state 10m is twice of 5m.
we saw that we should not associate numbers directly with nominal and ordinal data types, instead we can use vectors to represent them. in y=f(x), y is called the label and the x's are features. if we know both, then to predict f we use supervised learning methods like slr, mlr, etc. if we don't know the labels, we can predict f with unsupervised learning methods like hierarchical clustering, etc. in which we form clusters of x's, analyze each, and then convert them into labeled data.

288,"the lecture covered some basic ideas on machine learning and statistics. machine learning is essentially finding a relationship between features-inputs and labels-outputs. to achieve this, methods like linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, k-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering are used. these methods help solve problems like classification-grouping things-and regression-predicting values.
the lecture also introduced levels of measurement, which describe how data is categorized:
nominal data is applied to name things without any kind of order, such as color or gender.
ordinal data is ordered, but the difference between them is not consistent, like grades: a, b, c. encoding the ordinal data using numbers can lead to problems since it may suggest a difference that does not exist. using vectors will help to avoid this.
interval data is used for measurement, like temperature, where zero does not represent nothing.
ratio data includes things like height or weight, where zero means nothing, and you can compare values meaningfully (e.g., 10 kg is twice as heavy as 5 kg).
in machine learning, if the label is nominal, the problem is classification. if the label is interval or ratio, it is regression. machine learning can be supervised or unsupervised. in supervised learning, labels are already given, while in unsupervised learning, there are no labels. clustering methods are used in unsupervised learning to group data by similarity, and labels can be assigned later.
the last discussion about the difference between population and sample occurred. population refers to the entire dataset, but there can be a size that may be computationally expensive to analyze; thus, we often use a sample which is actually a smaller, manageable part of the data.",covered basic ideas machine learning statistics machine learning essentially finding relationship featuresinputs labelsoutputs achieve methods like linear regression logistic regression random forests kmeans clustering hierarchical clustering methods help solve problems like classificationgrouping thingsand regressionpredicting values also introduced levels measurement describe categorized nominal applied name things without kind order color gender ordinal ordered difference consistent like grades b c encoding ordinal using numbers lead problems since may suggest difference exist using vectors help avoid interval measurement like temperature zero represent nothing ratio includes things like height weight zero means nothing compare values meaningfully eg 10 kg twice heavy 5 kg machine learning label nominal problem classification label interval ratio regression machine learning supervised unsupervised supervised learning labels already given unsupervised learning labels clustering methods unsupervised learning group similarity labels assigned later last difference population sample occurred population refers entire dataset size may computationally expensive analyze thus often use sample actually smaller manageable part,152,7,26.211245,-13.996996,7,0.85345143,9

242,"in this lecture we started by looking at how results were used to be predicted earlier, without any ml models. people used to collect data, through experiments and observations and then by using those x and corresponding y values they used to manually fit the data into some curve/relation which could then be used to predict future values.
but with the advent of ml algorithms, the need to manually determine relations has vanished and we can use various available ml models to fit relations among collected data and the model can predict any future values fed to it. some of these algorithms include- linear and multiple regression, random forests, etc.
next, we studied about the 4 levels/scales of measurement- nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.
the nominal level categorizes the labels qualitatively into groups, which donâ€™t have any specific order. we can use frequency distributions to analyze this class of labels. also, since in nominal level, we do not consider ordering, it is incorrect to represent the values in terms of single numerical values. instead, we should use a vector which will have only one value as â€˜1â€™ and others â€˜0â€™ depending on which category the label y belongs to.
next, we talked about ordinal level which is associated with a specific sequence. the example we considered that of grades. grades have a specific order of importance but the interval between these is not fixed/defined.
the interval level consists of values that have equal intervals but the absolute zero for the measurements is not defined. in this level also, order matters. we discussed the example of temperature in celsius or fahrenheit scales. in these scales the 0 value is not absolute. so, we can just compare the difference between two values of temperature and comment on which one is hotter, but we cannot comment on the ratio of temperatures.
ratio class has an absolute zero defined and at this value it means that there is complete absence of that measurable. we considered example of height and weight here. so, heights of two persons can be compared and we can comment about the ratio of their heights. (eg. we can say a person with height of 5 ft is twice as tall as the one with height of 2.5ft.)
nominal and ordinal levels consist of discrete data, whereas interval and ratio levels contain continuous data.
next, we talked about supervised and unsupervised learning models:
supervised leaning models are the ones in which we feed the complete data, consisting of both the features and labels, based on which the ml model determines the future values. it uses classification or regression techniques for the same.
in unsupervised learning, only the x values are given based on the various x values (features) the machine learns by itself and makes clusters of values with similar features and assigns labels to each, after which it can predict futures values, based on the determined relations.
we use k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering algorithms for the same.
so, the ml models try to determine the function â€˜fâ€™ which relates y and x as y=f(x), based on available data.
we can always collect a sample of the entire population of data to develop these models.

554,"in today's class, we discussed levels of measurement for data, which include four types: 1) nominal, 2) ordinal, 3) interval, and 4) ratio. of these, nominal and ordinal are categorical data, while interval and ratio are numerical data.

nominal data has no inherent order among categories. examples include gender and nationality. ordinal data, on the other hand, is categorical with an inherent order but lacks meaningful intervals between categories, such as grades (a, b, c). for nominal and ordinal data, techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are used for feature representation. however, one-hot encoding can significantly increase the dimensionality of the dataset.

interval and ratio data are both continuous and numerical. interval data, such as temperature in â°c or â°f, has an arbitrary zero, meaning zero does not represent the absence of the quantity. in contrast, ratio data has an absolute zero, as in the case of temperature in kelvin (0k) or height, where zero indicates the complete absence of the quantity.

we also covered the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning. in supervised learning, the target variable (y) is provided, and the goal is to learn a function f that maps input features (x) to the output (y). techniques like linear regression and multiple regression are examples. in unsupervised learning, the target variable is not available, and the focus is on finding patterns in the data, such as clustering based on distance metrics like euclidean distance. examples include k-means and hierarchical clustering.

finally, we discussed the distinction between population and samples. all the data available on the internet represents samples of a larger population. machine learning models are trained on these samples and generalized to the population using proper validation techniques.",class levels measurement include four types 1 nominal 2 ordinal 3 interval 4 ratio nominal ordinal categorical interval ratio numerical nominal inherent order among categories examples include gender nationality ordinal hand categorical inherent order lacks meaningful intervals categories grades b c nominal ordinal techniques like onehot encoding label encoding feature representation however onehot encoding significantly increase dimensionality dataset interval ratio continuous numerical interval temperature â°c â°f arbitrary zero meaning zero represent absence quantity contrast ratio absolute zero case temperature kelvin 0k height zero indicates complete absence quantity also covered difference supervised unsupervised machine learning supervised learning target variable provided goal learn function f maps input features x output techniques like linear regression multiple regression examples unsupervised learning target variable available focus finding patterns clustering based distance metrics like euclidean distance examples include kmeans hierarchical clustering finally distinction population samples available internet represents samples larger population machine learning models trained samples generalized population using proper validation techniques,156,7,27.515947,-10.8079815,7,0.8122041,26
364,"today's class covered the concepts of simple and multiple linear regression, logistic regression and k-means clustering theoretically. we also covered the 4 different levels of measurement namely nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. nominal and ordinal deal with categorical and discrete variables while interval and ratio are for continuous variables. nominal is primarily used for qualitative and quantitative data presentation and ordinal like in case of gender or colour and ordinal is primarily for ranking data in a particular order. interval deals with a particular order too but between two specific points. in this case zero value is considered arbitrary. an example is temperature- relation between 100â°c and 50â°c is not the same as 50â°c and 25â°c but same as 150â°c and 100â°c. they do not have a linear relationship as zero is not the true zero in this level. ratio considers a true zero and linear relations may exist.

217,"machine learning is the application of statistics in different ways like linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, etc. there are 4 levels of measurement: - 1) nominal type: it is a discrete type of measurement for example gender and color. in this measurement, there is no ordering defined. it differentiates the characteristics of something that you are measuring. 2) ordinal type: in this type, there is a sequence or order. it is also a discrete type. example: grades. 3) interval type: it is a continuous type. example: temperature. only the difference matters in the case of intervals. in temperature zero has an arbitrary definition. 4) ratio type: it is also a continuous type. it's all about existence. for example: height, weight, salary, etc.

46,"so today we started off with the basics of data science, where we discussed that y = f(x) is basically the crux of data science, where we try to find different unknowns based on the data given to us. y is known as labels, while x is known as features (plural as it can be represented as a vector i.e. a collection of multiple entities). we discussed that the main motive of ml is to fit the most appropriate curve which can depict the given observational data, and unlike human calculations, which will lead us to some mathematical equations, the output of ml algorithms is an empirical equation. we talked about 4 algorithms i.e. simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, random forest and logistic regression. 
then we moved on to discuss the levels of measurement. there are 4 levels:
i) nominal - no ordering, only classification is possible. differentiation based on some characteristics, discrete. eg. gender, colour
ii) ordinal - inherent order between different groups. discrete. eg. grades
iii) interval - only the difference between entries matters, reference is arbitrary. continuous. eg. temperature
iv) ratio - reference is well defined. continuous. eg. height, weight

we also discussed the appropriate way of encoding data for using the algorithms. we should not use numbers directly as that may change our level of measurement from nominal to ordinal. instead we should use as many variables as there are categories, and use one hot encoding to create a vector, where each bit represents a particular character. 
we also suggested that nominal and ordinal level data can be classified into different groups, whereas interval and ratio level data can use regression to find relations between different observations. 
finally, we started with unsupervised learning, which is the branch of ml which deals with data where we do not have labels y, and we basically need to form clusters or groups based on some characteristic of the data points. there are 2 main classification algorithms, k - means clustering and hierarchial clustering.

then we moved on to levels of measurement: there are four types: nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio. 

1. nominal includes discrete data which we can not arrange in a specific order( no one is bigger or smaller) like colours. 
2. whereas ordinals are discrete and can be comapred. 
3. intervals are the units where only difference holds not ratio. suppose, there are 5c and 10 deg c. we can not say 10 is twice as 5 deg c because we compare wrt kelvin where this statement will not hold true.
4. ratio. as the name suggest we can also take ratio. for eg height.

y=f(x1,x2,x3,x4..)
where y is the label and x1,x2,x3... are generally features in a problem of classification.

supervised learning :
        labels and features are known we predict and approximate the function f.
unsupervised learning:
        only features are present. we can just group the data on the basis of some parameters.

data availability: 
               the whole data set which includes each and everything is called population.
                  sample data is a subset of population.

and how using ml techniques curve or graph are plotted for scatter plot for given data to know the relation between input and output which forms empirical equation. along with that we learnt the four levels of measurement which are :
1. nominal - in this no particular order or sequence is followed for data values. it takes discrete values. for example, gender or colours in which one value is not at higher or lower value from the other this are not in particular order but at same level.
2. ordinal - in this data  follows a certain specific order or sequence. basically it has a inherited order but it also has discrete data values. for example, grades which have discrete values but grades have a high or low value.
3. interval - in this data is divided into certain intervals in a particular order, but zero has a arbitrary meaning. it has continuous data values. for example, temperature ( 5â°c is not twice as cold as 10â°c in actual. )
4. ratio - data follows a particular order with equal intervals but zero do have a meaning. it also has a continuous data. for example, height and weight.

nominal and ordinal falls in classification category of ml while internal and ratio falls in regression category of ml.

learnt about y=f(x), where u is label and x known as features. in supervised learning labels are known but in unsupervised they aren't. in unsupervised k means clustering and hierarchical clustering are used to make label for problems.

335,"we started with the equation y=f(x) (for fluid flowing in pipe) where we have the values of the inputs (i.e. flow values) and output (temperature). earlier people used to derive the relationship between the inputs and the outputs empirically using mathematical formulations.
but now we have many machine learning algorithms which can give us the relationship:
1. slr -> simple linear regression
2. mlr -> multiple linear regression
3. logistic regression
4. random forest
5. k-means clustering
6. hierarchical clustering

then we discussed about the 4 levels of measurement:

1. nominal: eg - gender, color
    the data in this level of measurement can only be classified into different groups. there is  
    no ordering and the data is discrete.
2. ordinal: eg - grades
    this is also discrete like nominal but has an inherent order associated with it.

for working with the data we encode it by assigning the labels some values (like male-1, female-2, etc.) which is fundamentally wrong as we are completely ignoring the values of the assigned numbers.
instead, we can use one-hot code for the labels which acts as a switch making only a single value 1 and rest of them to be zero. for example, if we are classifying images of animals then for an image of a monkey the values will be [dog-0, cat-0, monkey-1, horse-0].

3. interval: eg - temperature, ph, credit score
    the data in this level of measurement is continuous. zero here is arbitrarily defined and  
    has no real meaning.
4. ratio: eg - height, weight, salary
    this is also continuous but here zero has a meaning in this level of measurement.

both nominal and ordinal levels are discrete and they fall under the classification ml category whereas interval and ratio fall under the regression category.

in the equation y=f(x), y are the labels and x are the features.

1. supervised learning: when we have both labels and features it is called 'supervised 
     learning'.
2. unsupervised learning: when we only have features and no labels it is called 
    'unsupervised learning'. 
    in this we use the features to group data into clusters and then on the basis of their 
    similarities we can define their labels and then predict the correct group for any new x.

at last we looked into the population for our data is too large that either we don't have access to all the population's data or we can't normally process such a large data.

187,"sir started by talking about y = f(x). he first talked about old and new methods of data analysis. for this he took the example of finding the temperature difference between the two ends of a pipe using the flow rate of the fluid flowing inside the pipe. y was the temperature difference denoted by delta-t and x was the flow rate.

in the old methods we used to get the equation relating y = f(x) like dt = l23, while in the new methods we get data points and obtain a plot of the curve which relates temperature difference with the corresponding flow rate.

there are 4 level of measurements: 

1. nominal (discrete) - no ordering in this level of measurements , no calculated value associated with it. ml category - classification 

2. ordinal (discrete) - they have a sequence and associating a number to nominal and ordinal is not correct. ml category - classification  
we have to encode the names as vectors like dog [ 1 0 0 0 ] , cat [ 0 0 0 1 ] 

3. interval(continuous)-for eg 5 and 10 degree celsius like we don't have, since the concept of reference matters. in case of this , we have 0 has arbitrary defined . ml category - regression

346,"before the advent of machine learning, research involving relationships between variables, such as predicting temperature difference from flow rate, typically involved manually fitting curves to data. this required researchers to hypothesize and test various equations (e.g., delta t = l^2, l^3, 1/l).

with the emergence of machine learning (ml), the approach shifted. instead of manually fitting curves, researchers employ a wide array of ml algorithms. these algorithms allow models to learn the underlying relationships within the data without the need to explicitly define the equation's form. essentially, ml algorithms search for the best fit within a predefined set of functions.

levels of measurement

the level of measurement of a variable significantly impacts the types of operations that can be performed on the data.

nominal: variables at this level have no inherent order (e.g., gender, color). they are discrete and categorical.
ordinal: these variables have an order but the intervals between them may not be equal (e.g., grades: a, b, c). they are also discrete.
interval: these variables have a consistent scale, but zero is arbitrary (e.g., temperature in celsius). they are continuous.
ratio: these variables have a true zero point and consistent intervals (e.g., height, temperature in kelvin, salary). they are continuous.
assigning values to nominal or ordinal variables can introduce bias. for example, arbitrarily assigning numerical values (e.g., a=1, b=2, c=3) may imply an incorrect quantitative relationship between categories. a more appropriate approach is to represent these variables using vectors (e.g., a=[1,0,0], b=[0,1,0], c=[0,0,1]).

while continuous variables like temperature are often measured discretely (e.g., by thermometers), they are typically assumed to be continuous for the purposes of data analysis.

supervised learning

in supervised learning, the goal is to predict a target variable (y) based on a set of input features (x).

if y is a nominal or ordinal variable, the task is classification.
if y is an interval or ratio variable, the task is regression.
unsupervised learning

in unsupervised learning, the data lacks labels (i.e., the value of y is unknown). the goal is to discover patterns and relationships within the data using only the features (x). common techniques include k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.

data and sampling

the entire collection of data points constitutes the population. in ml, algorithms typically work with a sample of the data, which is a subset of the population. it's crucial to understand that no matter how large the sample, it will always represent a portion of the population.",advent machine learning research involving relationships variables predicting temperature difference flow rate typically involved manually fitting curves required researchers hypothesize test equations eg delta l2 l3 1l emergence machine learning ml approach shifted instead manually fitting curves researchers employ wide array ml algorithms algorithms allow models learn underlying relationships within without need explicitly define equations form essentially ml algorithms search best fit within predefined set functions levels measurement level measurement variable significantly impacts types operations performed nominal variables level inherent order eg gender color discrete categorical ordinal variables order intervals may equal eg grades b c also discrete interval variables consistent scale zero arbitrary eg temperature celsius continuous ratio variables true zero point consistent intervals eg height temperature kelvin salary continuous assigning values nominal ordinal variables introduce bias arbitrarily assigning numerical values eg a1 b2 c3 may imply incorrect quantitative relationship categories appropriate approach represent variables using vectors eg a100 b010 c001 continuous variables like temperature often measured discretely eg thermometers typically assumed continuous purposes analysis supervised learning supervised learning goal predict target variable based set input features x nominal ordinal variable task classification interval ratio variable task regression unsupervised learning unsupervised learning lacks labels ie value unknown goal discover patterns relationships within using features x common techniques include kmeans clustering hierarchical clustering sampling entire collection points constitutes population ml algorithms typically work sample subset population crucial understand matter large sample always represent portion population,235,7,23.079884,-10.836583,7,0.73025465,50

459,"there were 3 main topic of discussion in todays lecture:

1. types of ml algorithms like simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, k-means clustering, etc.

2. level of measurement:
    1. nominal scale: datapoints are discrete, mutually exclusive and no arithmetic operation can be performed on this. eg: gender, color

    2. ordinal scale: datapoints are discrete, numerical but same unit of distance doesnâ€™t have same significance. for eg: grading, you have values from letâ€™s say 10 (for aa) to 4 (for dd). now why i was saying that the numerical values doesnâ€™t have significance because the difference between (cd and dd) is 1 grade points and the difference between the (aa and ab) is also 1 grade points. so numerically this means the jump from ddâ†’cd and abâ†’aa is same which is definitely not true.
        
        here we shortly discussed about how to encode the datapoints gathered using nominal scale. and we delved into the problem that directly using numbers to represent the datapoints is incorrect so we used the concept of vectors and how we use vectors to represent these data. and this vector way of representing things is called onehotencoding in the ml landscape.
        
    3. interval scale: datapoints are discrete, numerical and same unit of distance have same significance. for eg: temperature scale, you have values from letâ€™s say 100(degrees c) to 0(degrees c). if you go from 40â†’50 or 80â†’90 the change in temperature is 10 and this will feel same in both the cases.

    4. ratio scale: datapoints are discrete, numerical, same unit of distance have same significance and has a zero. for eg: in temperature scale if you have 0 it doesnâ€™t means you have absence of temperature which means 0 doesnâ€™t have significance in the scale. now take the example of height, weight, etc. where letâ€™s say you have 0 as the datapoint so it means that the object has no height according to the measuring scale (by the way this depends on the least count measuring scale).

3. types of problems in machine learning:
    1. supervised learning: we have a set of input features and an output feature. and our job is to determine the relation between input and output. this has 2 types of sub-problems: regression and classification. here regression refers to those problem which have continuous set of values in the output feature and in classification you have some finite number of different labels and our job is to determine the label of a datapoint based on input features.

    2. unsupervised learning: when we only have input features. here we discussed about clustering algorithms which is used to cluster the datapoints based on some sort of similarity finding algorithm (using euclidean distance, cosine similarity, etc).

4. we also shortly delved into the difference between population and sample. got to know about how all the machine learning problems are trying to learn from samples and based on the finding of relation of input and output (y = f(x)) trying to predict the behavior of population.",3 main topic 1 types ml algorithms like simple linear regression multiple linear regression logistic regression random forest kmeans clustering etc 2 level measurement 1 nominal scale datapoints discrete mutually exclusive arithmetic operation performed eg gender color 2 ordinal scale datapoints discrete numerical unit distance doesnâ€™t significance eg grading values letâ€™s say 10 aa 4 dd saying numerical values doesnâ€™t significance difference cd dd 1 grade points difference aa ab also 1 grade points numerically means jump ddâ†’cd abâ†’aa definitely true shortly encode datapoints gathered using nominal scale delved problem directly using numbers represent datapoints incorrect concept vectors use vectors represent vector way representing things called onehotencoding ml landscape 3 interval scale datapoints discrete numerical unit distance significance eg temperature scale values letâ€™s say 100degrees c 0degrees c go 40â†’50 80â†’90 change temperature 10 feel cases 4 ratio scale datapoints discrete numerical unit distance significance zero eg temperature scale 0 doesnâ€™t means absence temperature means 0 doesnâ€™t significance scale take height weight etc letâ€™s say 0 datapoint means object height according measuring scale way depends least count measuring scale 3 types problems machine learning 1 supervised learning set input features output feature job determine relation input output 2 types subproblems regression classification regression refers problem continuous set values output feature classification finite number different labels job determine label datapoint based input features 2 unsupervised learning input features clustering algorithms cluster datapoints based sort similarity finding algorithm using euclidean distance cosine similarity etc 4 also shortly delved difference population sample got know machine learning problems trying learn samples based finding relation input output fx trying predict behavior population,267,7,29.266878,-12.612131,7,0.6103853,55

simple linear regression: y=ax+b
here, y is the dependent variable or label, also called as response variable, and x is the feature or the independent variable. 

bias: introduced in models to address or approximate the effects of variables not explicitly included in the model.
if the confidence is low then, the confidence interval shrinks while if the confidence is 100% then we get an infinite confidence interval. 
we estimate the unknown parameters a and b in y=ax+b using the idea of minimizing the sum of squares of errors. 

closed form solutions: an exact and explicit mathematical expression that solves a given problem or equation in terms of known functions and constants. 

using the method of minimizing the sum of squares of errors, we get the closed form solution for the simple regression model for single predictor. however these are point estimates and we need to arrive at the possible interval in which these values lie such that there is higher chance that the population parameters lie within the intervals.

sir started by talking about y = f(x). he first talked about old and new methods of data analysis. for this he took the example of finding the temperature difference between the two ends of a pipe using the flow rate of the fluid flowing inside the pipe. y was the temperature difference denoted by delta-t and x was the flow rate.
in the old methods we used to get the equation relating y = f(x) like dt = l23, while in the new methods we get data points and obtain a plot of the curve which relates temperature difference with the corresponding flow rate.
then he talked about the methods that we use for obtaining the plot which are:
1.	slr â€“ simple linear regression
2.	mlr â€“ multiple linear regression
3.	logistic regression
4.	random forest
he also mentioned k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.
then he said that there are two paths which are machine-learning and the other one is statistics, in this course we would frequently move from one path to another to get the assigned task done.
he then started talking about levels of measurement. there are four levels of measurement:
1.	nominal (discrete): for example, gender, color, etc. 
to explain, in this if two people have different gender no one is superior the other, all of them are equal.
2.	ordinal (discrete): for example, grades
but now how would the computer identify these (here, gender) as distinct because we need to associate some number with each grade for the computer to recognize them.
but if we assign numbers like male -1, female-2 and so on then we are doing something that is fundamentally wrong because we are attaching higher value to one of the them whereas, they should be equal.
in order to take care of this issue we use vectors and use them as a switch. it would be difficult to show that it here but sir has drawn that very nicely in his notes (uploaded on moodle).
example: dog [1 0 0 0]
3.	interval (continuous) for example, temperature
sir said that scale on which we are measuring will not create any issues.
4.	ratio (continuous) for example, height, weight, salary
y is known as label and x is known as feature.
supervised and unsupervised learning problems
a problem in which we know both the values of the label and the features is known as supervised learning problem.

then sir defined a function 
monthly-purchases = f (salary, month of year, size of family, etc.)
then he talked about the ml categories about each of the level of measurement: 
nominal â€“ classification
ordinal â€“ classification
interval â€“ regression
ratio â€“ regression
then he talked about unsupervised learning in which we donâ€™t know the value of labels associated with features.
there is hierarchical and k-means clustering. then he explained clustering by using a graph between features.
it is difficult to explain the flow chart (on page 9) in sirâ€™s notes but it is quite clear by looking at the flow chart.

we take a representative sample out of the population in order to save time and money for data analysis.

building on that, the instructor delved into broader aspects of eda, discussing various techniques and strategies for handling different types of challenges encountered during data exploration. he emphasized that understanding the nuances of eda is critical for diagnosing data issues, cleaning datasets, and ensuring the accuracy of the analysis. key points included methods for managing missing values, outliers, and other common data irregularities that can skew results.

the session then transitioned to a real-world demonstration, where the instructor showcased eda on datasets from a chemical plant and a solar plant project he had worked on. through this demonstration, he illustrated how comprehensive data analysis, when well-documented and carefully presented, can drive insightful decision-making and operational improvements. the importance of creating clear, detailed reports was highlighted, ensuring that the insights derived from eda are accessible and actionable for stakeholders.

318,"in this lecture, we continued our discussion on eda. we learnt how to create pivot tables in excel, which summarize the entire data into a table, whose entries can be chosen by us. this will help us create a summary of the data and understand the various trends and patterns in the data. using the pivot table entries, one can then create plots to analyze the distribution/ pattern in the data. this can be used to predict any desired value in future. the example which we discussed in class was that of the average number of characters in the summary on any particular day. this can be useful to predict the approximate number of characters in the summary of any day in the future.
we can use various plots including- box plots, scatter plots, histograms, as well as descriptive statistics function in excel to determine the outliers in the data set. any of these can be used to reach out to a conclusion regarding the outliers. also, it is not always correct to completely disregard the outliers, as they may also reveal certain important problems, patterns in the data, which cannot be ignored.
eda includes all these tasks of cleaning, comprehending, analyzing the data and extracting valuable insights from it, which can be further used to build a model. 
apart from this, we also looked at two case studies. one was regarding the measurements of numerous different parameters related to a process in chemical plant, with the measurements collected on daily basis. we created a pivot table which included the various parameters in the columns and the dates in the rows. then we added the values of- count of the total measurements made in that year, the average, max, min of these measurements for each of the parameter. we observed in some cases, the min value of the parameter dropped to 0, which cannot be practically possible, as we cannot have 0 pressure or temperature. the problem occurred due to the missing values of these parameters on some days.
the next case study was about the creation of energy using solar radiation. the oil and water temperatures were recorded at different time intervals, and the data was available. various line plots were created to analyze the variation in these temperatures at different times of the day and further on different days.
correlation maps were also made to understand the correlation between the various independent variables. there were certain patterns in the temperatures, from birdâ€™s eye point of view. however, more distinct patterns were observed within these large variations, when looked through a zoomed in perspective, suggesting hour-to-hour as well as daily variations in the temperatures. all these plots could be analyzed, to help us understand how we can separate the noise from the signals, identify the outliers, and use them to predict the values of the output variable in the future.

next, we analyzed a sensor dataset with observations for each date. using pivot tables, we counted the number of data points for each year, which helped us select which data to use for training. we also visualized the input and output columns using line graphs, which allowed us to observe how the output changed with different inputs. by applying principal component analysis (pca), we discovered that only 17 out of 240 columns were needed to capture most of the variance in the data, meaning these 17 columns would be the independent features to use for further analysis.

then, we examined a problem of real interest involving optimization for a chemical plant, where several parameters were analysed through various plots. among the observations was a distribution that seemed to be normal, except for some odd readings at the low extreme, perhaps caused by faulty sensors. but instead of throwing them away, the value of domain knowledge was highlighted, with a mention of an instance where early data exclusion resulted in incorrect conclusions. another instance involving transformer failures was also mentioned. towards the end, the teaching assistants participated in the session to give feedback on an assignment e2 bringing the lecture to a close.",started objectives exploratory analysis gain insights identify anomalies test hypotheses validate assumptions looked dataset course submissions previous lectures looking features length submission entries much longer others suggesting potential outliers pivot tables analyse examined problem real interest involving optimization chemical plant several parameters analysed plots among observations distribution seemed normal except odd readings low extreme perhaps caused faulty sensors instead throwing away value domain knowledge highlighted mention instance early exclusion resulted incorrect conclusions another instance involving transformer failures also mentioned towards end teaching assistants participated give feedback assignment e2 bringing close,90,8,-0.8599757,24.603619,8,0.7735096,25
315,"in today's session we we started with pivot tables and how to use them to draw inferences from the data using min, max, std dev etc. it's a necesssary part of the exploratory data analysis. then we saw how to see how many outliers we have and how they vary within the data by using line plots, histograms, scatter plots and box plots. the decision boundary which is usually between q1-1.5iqr and q3+1.5iqr can be changed according to the data and its just a common practice to use 1.5 and we could have higher or lower number than that according to the data we have. if in our data we have large difference between mean and median, the mean is severely affected by the outliers and hence it indicates that the outliers exist in the data. outliers are not always insignificant and they may be telling crucial exceptions that may be occuring in our system and its useful that way in telling us about the potential failures in sensors and other things. later we discussed two industry projects where eda was heavily utilised in getting insights from the data and raising necessary questions which would later be utilised to solve the data on a large scale.

67,"class started by the introduction to pivot table. we can find various parameters of a data like average of total characters, sum, min, max and std of the total characters. we analyzed the data of the submissions of summaries. we checked the histogram  for the average number of characters. we noticed that the majority of the portion lies in the lesser number of characters. we further created a box plot to find that there were some outliers in the data. 
we calculated the skewness and kurtosis and plotted a scatter plot to support the conclusion for outliers. 
we get shape of distribution by the histogram. other methods can help us know about the outliers. 
for the data, we explored the maximum submissions, the minimum submission, the number of times they have submitted. then, we went to ""who on which date submitted what length of submission?"". there were several missing values in the overall sheet. 
sir moved to the chemical plant data. we understood how data can be calculated for every 5 min or every hour. but it will just explode the data. to find the inner fluctuations, we need to dub up data. on using pivot table, we found that a lot of data is missing. we went to the min, max and average value of the data. we found an anomaly: min value for zero for a parameter. to check the place in which the error occurred we cut down the observations into small chunks until we found it. on plotting this data, these anomalies were clearly visible. we also created histogram and box plots. it is a good practice to create all the images and view them at once. we noticed how the plots with and without outliers look different from one another.  later, we proceeded to see the documentation of the data. in the anomaly and questions were highlighted. we do not want to exclude feature that may be useful. we went on to check how many of the variables are independent. we noticed that out of these hundreds of data rows. we only need 17 principle component or 17 independent process to describe the entire process. also, we can reorganize data and bring similar observation together. this makes the heatmap look better. 
we also checked for the data obtained from a transformer operations. the incomplete can be from sensor failure or device failure. we noticed how there can be points where hypothesis can be generated and we need to decide if to accept it or reject it. quality of input depends on the quality of our exploratory data analysis.

200,"todayâ€™s class start with a discussion on how do we eliminate noise from dataset. noise makes it difficult to find a trend in data therefore it is becomes a necessary part of exploratory data analysis. we learn one method named â€œsimple moving averageâ€ in which we consider a window around every data point and average the values. window width can be varied to adjust the level of smoothing. higher window size makes more smoothing. this method is also used for filling up missing values, replacing outliers.
another method is â€œexponential moving averageâ€ which works better on time series data. one good practice is that first removes the outliers then apply moving averages method. next we learnt about the standardization and normalization of datasets. linear regression model is immune to the data scaling but many models such as gradient descent method is not. clustering algorithm based on euclidean distance will greatly influence by scaling the data. the normalization makes value lie between [0,1] using formula such as x=[x-x(min)/ x(max)-x(min)] and the standardization creates standard normal distribution. normalization does not change the shape of distribution of the data. we use log transformation when data is heteroscadascity. next we discuss about data imbalance which happens when certain instances of a class might show up more frequency than others. example rare disease diagnostic, forgery. we can overcome this by either under sampling the majority class or over sampling the minority class. we can do this with the help of smote tool.",todayâ€™s class start eliminate noise dataset noise makes difficult find trend therefore becomes necessary part exploratory analysis learn one method named â€œsimple moving averageâ€ consider window around every point average values window width varied adjust level smoothing higher window size makes smoothing method also filling missing values replacing outliers another method â€œexponential moving averageâ€ works time series one good practice first removes outliers apply moving averages method next standardization normalization datasets linear regression model immune scaling many models gradient descent method clustering algorithm based euclidean distance greatly influence scaling normalization makes value lie 01 using formula xxxmin xmaxxmin standardization creates standard normal distribution normalization change shape distribution use log transformation heteroscadascity next discuss imbalance happens certain instances class might show frequency others rare disease diagnostic forgery overcome either sampling majority class sampling minority class help smote tool,137,9,11.451326,35.52384,9,0.8624291,1

28,"during exploratory data analysis we get insights on type of data and understand problems present in the data. we can remove outliers based on trend followed by data: if all data follows a particular trend and some doesn't follow we can remove this data. we can use data smoothening to reduce noise in data. real data has a lot of fluctuations. this can make it difficult to find trends ir pattern in such data. simple moving average sma consider a window around every data points and average the values. window width can be varied to adjust the level of smoothening. based on application we can take window width. we can take moving average at a point as average of all past points or average of some past and some future points. there will be problems at the end of data as there won't be any points to the past of starting of data. so we have to define accordingly at end points. the moving average reduce the noise and maintains the characteristics data. another way is exponential moving average that weight nearby samples more while averaging. this is used in time series forecasting.
in data analysis, it is crucial to handle missing values and outliers before proceeding with further steps like calculating moving averages. ignoring these aspects can lead to distorted results, such as sudden changes or incorrect trend patterns. handling missing values can be done by either ignoring, discarding, or using methods like regression to fill in the gaps. outliers should be removed or adjusted to prevent them from skewing the analysis. after addressing these issues, the data is ready for further analysis, where both visual and mathematical methods are used to ensure accuracy. normalization transforms data to a 0-1 range. in this case, normalization had little effect on the target values and coefficients, with minimal changes except for one variable (x2). this shows that scaling didn't significantly impact the model. for the next messy dataset, a clustering algorithm is suggested. in the process of data analysis, independent normalization of variables (x and y) can impact the results, especially when using algorithms like k-means clustering, which rely on euclidean distance. when the data is normalized, it alters the shape and relationships between variables, leading to more refined results. algorithms sensitive to scaling, such as k-means, are particularly affected, and normalization helps produce more accurate clusters by balancing the influence of different features.


a standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and variance of 1. to standardize data, the formula is used, where is an observation, is the mean, and is the standard deviation. standardization does not change the shape of the data's distribution, meaning the transformed data retains the original distribution's shape. this method is often used in statistical tests, especially hypothesis testing, where normal distribution is required. data transformations like box-cox are applied to achieve normality before performing such tests. descriptive statistics of the transformations should be reviewed to understand their impact.
the box-cox transformation is a technique used to make data more normally distributed. it involves raising each observation to a power (lambda), with the optimal lambda value determined through a process called maximum likelihood estimation. in this case, the lambda value is 0.17, which is chosen to best transform the data into a normal distribution. this method is useful when algorithms assume normality in the data, ensuring that the data fits those assumptions.
the box-cox transformation and similar techniques, like square root or cube root transformations, pull data points closer together, particularly those that are far from the mean. this helps in dealing with skewed distributions. for a lambda value close to 0 in box-cox, the transformation approximates ; if lambda is 0, it uses the log transformation. the result is a more normally distributed dataset, which is essential for certain algorithms. when applying transformations like box-cox or logarithmic transformations to features (e.g., x1), these same transformations must be applied consistently to future or test data to ensure accurate predictions. additionally, sometimes transformations must be reversed to interpret results in their original context. various scaling methods, such as standardization and normalization, are commonly used to handle such transformations.
the condition where data variance changes across different levels of the data is known as heteroscedasticity.
the process of scaling data, such as using log transformations, reduces the emphasis on large values and minimizes the impact of variations in data. this is crucial because many algorithms, especially those that rely on euclidean distance or hierarchical clustering, are sensitive to data scaling. various scaling methods are used to bring the data to a common scale while preserving the variation within the dataset. however, in some cases, transformations like the box-cox transformation are applied to also change the shape of the data for better analysis.
when preparing data for analysis, steps include identifying and fixing missing values, exploring correlations between features, and creating visual representations like scatter plots or matrix plots. scaling transformations are often applied before conducting these analyses to ensure accurate and consistent results.
the issue of data imbalance arises when certain classes are underrepresented in a dataset compared to other classes. this is particularly problematic in classification tasks. in the example given, there are four classes: red, green, blue, and white, where the white class is underrepresented and often merged with the blue class. when subjecting these classes to classification, boundaries are created by the algorithm based on the dominant class, leading to misclassification of the underrepresented class.
as a result, false negatives occur, where observations belonging to the underrepresented class are wrongly classified as another class. this is evident in confusion matrices and the performance metrics like precision and recall, where the underrepresented class shows poor classification. the algorithm focuses on correctly classifying the majority class, but the minority class suffers from poor performance.
data imbalance occurs when one class significantly dominates over others in a dataset, causing challenges for learning algorithms. this imbalance can negatively affect the algorithmâ€™s ability to learn, particularly in cases like medical diagnosis (e.g., diabetes detection) or fraud detection, where underrepresented classes are crucial. algorithms may become biased toward the majority class, leading to misclassification and poor performance for minority classes.
an example of this is in the detection of exoplanets based on flux values from distant star systems. most stars do not have planets, meaning the dataset is heavily skewed, with 99.3% representing stars without planets and only 0.7% representing stars with planets. in this case, the algorithm may focus on the majority class (stars without planets) and miss important patterns in the minority class.
to address this, data needs to be balanced or projected into a lower-dimensional space for better visualization and understanding. algorithms require different performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall) to detect the presence of data imbalance and ensure that the model learns effectively from both the majority and minority classes. neglecting this can lead to biased models that perform poorly on critical underrepresented classes.

in cases of data imbalance, particularly when the disparity between majority and minority classes is not extreme, dropping a small number of values from the majority class can be acceptable without significantly affecting the sample's representativeness. however, if the difference is significant, dropping too many values from the majority class may lead to a sample that is no longer representative of the population.
one approach to address data imbalance is oversampling the minority class by duplicating its data points. however, this method does not introduce new information; it merely replicates existing data, which can water down the dataset without solving the core issue of imbalance.
a more effective method is using synthetic minority over-sampling technique (smote). instead of duplicating data points, smote generates synthetic samples by selecting a minority class data point and creating new points as linear interpolations between it and its nearest neighbors. this method enhances the representation of the minority class while maintaining diversity in the dataset. by creating synthetic samples, smote helps improve the balance without simply duplicating existing data, providing a better way to handle data imbalance in machine learning tasks.
some other data balancing are adasyn. tomek links are used to to undersample data. majority class with their nearest neighbor being a minority class sample are removed. smote and tomek links are done one after other to get nice data.

502,"we started off the class by discussing about outliers and how they can be found out using scatter plots and box plots. they can also be found out by descriptive statistics and line charts. however whether to actually ignore and drop the outliers or to perform some processing on them, depends upon the domain and thus required domain knowledge. sometimes, outliers can be hidden in the data, which can be observed by maybe rescaling the data or by dropping the true outliers and then observing the remaining data again. now we need to smoothen out our data and remove all the noise, in order to observe some trends in the actual data. thus, we perform data smothering, which could be done by various methods. we discussed about simple moving averages, where we consider a window around every data point and average the values in that window. the window width can be adjusted according to the level of smoothening. but in doing so, we need to take care about missing values as well, or else our smoothening algorithm might not work correctly. the higher the window size, the smoother our data becomes. we also have methods called exponential moving average or weighted moving average, which weighs the nearer points more as compared to the farther points. 
we then moved on to handling data where each column has a different scale. suppose we have a data where one column has very large values as compared to another column. this becomes a problem when we try to run a model like multiple regression, as the larger value data creates a very large maxima, which leads to all the other minimas getting overshadowed. hence gradient descent is not able to find the most optimum minima and the algorithm fails. hence we need to scale our data appropriately to prevent this. the most common method of scaling is to scale each column data to lie between 0 and 1. we then discussed that any algorithm which depends upon euclidean distances, like the k-means clustering algorithm, will be affected by the normalisation of the data. we could also perform an operation known as standardisation, which comes from the term â€˜standard normal distributionâ€™ i.e. n (0, 1). standardisation and normalisation do not change the shape of the distribution of the data.
the difference between the mean and the median of the data also gives us an idea about the skewness of the data, where a larger difference indicates more skewness. 
we then discussed about various other transformations like logarithmic transformation, where we de-emphasise the higher values. this transformation actually changes the shape of the distribution of the data. 
we then moved on to data imbalances, which is mainly used in the context of classification. it means that data from one class is highly under-represented as compared to the other classes. in such cases, we can either under-sample the majority class, or generate data belonging to the minority class. we could use smote algorithm, which creates synthetic samples based on linear interpolation between the existing samples. the hyper parameters for this algorithm are the number of neighbours we want and the smote percentage. we also have tomek links, which under sample the majority class data.

111,"we began by looking at how outliers affect the data plots, and how much of a difference it can make (we saw a graphical representation after removing outliers and rescaling to better understand the data). we also saw how noise can change the signal data and in order to fix it we started learning about data smoothing. fluctuations due to noise can make it difficult to identify trends and patterns, and can even lead to wrong analysis, hence the need for cleaning. sma stands for simple moving average, it a moving window average, it's a form of low effort filter, to filter and check data. we start with let's say 50 data points and underlying trend is visible after that, then we have a higher window size to do more smoothing. when we come to the end points we can choose to stop the moving average according to the type of method we're choosing (if we say that moving average of a window is at the left most point of the window, then we'll have to ignore the right most end point). there are other methods like exponential moving averages that weigh nearby samples more, also used in time series forecasting. then we observed the clustering of data, and again we went through the data of session summary and saw the graphs of plotted values of number of submissions and the length of summaries. we also saw standardized and normalized transformations. we saw how a skewed distribution can turn into normal distribution with transformation, we should be aware when to apply the transformation and how it'll be useful. then we to got to see kepler exoplanet data, plotting the flux values for stars belonging to two classes. data imbalance, and we saw techniques to see data imbalance, either by under-sampling the majority class or over-sampling the minority. or, a more interesting approach is to generate synthetic data for minority, which is a type of oversampling. we understood how smote oversamples the minority class, minority classes with samples with nearest neighbor being minority class are removed.",began looking outliers affect plots much difference make saw graphical representation removing outliers rescaling understand also saw noise change signal order fix started learning smoothing fluctuations due noise make difficult identify trends patterns even lead wrong analysis hence need cleaning sma stands simple moving average moving window average form low effort filter filter check start lets say 50 points underlying trend visible higher window size smoothing come end points choose stop moving average according type method choosing say moving average window left point window well ignore right end point methods like exponential moving averages weigh nearby samples also time series forecasting observed clustering went saw graphs plotted values number submissions length summaries also saw standardized normalized transformations saw skewed distribution turn normal distribution transformation aware apply transformation itll useful got see kepler exoplanet plotting flux values stars belonging two classes imbalance saw techniques see imbalance either undersampling majority class oversampling minority interesting approach generate synthetic minority type oversampling understood smote oversamples minority class minority classes samples nearest neighbor minority class removed,171,9,10.559115,36.22902,9,0.8219812,6
539,"today we learnt topic about data smoothening to reduce noise. one of the method used in data smoothening is moving averages. this method makes the data less noise and  helps in detecting the trend better , another method is exponential moving averages these are mainly utilised in time series here weighted averages are taken. its important to handle missing values and outliers before applying moving averages. few techniques to handle missing values are winzorisation , imputation, trimming, cap data and robust estimation. we then saw the importance of data scaling and its various methods like normalisation, standardisation and box-cox methods. all euclidian distance models are not immune to the data without data scaling. few models assume normal data distribution in such scenarios we have to use box-cox scaling method. standardisation and normalisation doesn't change the shape of the original distribution. log transformation is used when there is heteroscedasticity in the data that is variance keeps on changing across the dataset. log deemphasises large values. we later saw how to handle data imbalance which primarily occurs in clustering problems in this we have three options 
1) under sample the majority 
2)oversample the minority- that is duplication of the same minority data many times
3) produce synthetic data.
the first two methods are naã¯ve and not usually recommended.
to do the third method we use smote method which helps us in synthesising new data points for the minority class. it works on euclidean distance method it connects two minority points and forms a new point on the line (uses k-nearest neighbours method to do this) the data should be scaled before passing it on to smote, other methods used for synthetic data production are adasyn, borderline-smote. tomek links is a method used to under sample the majority class it deletes the majority points which are very close to the border of the minority points. usually smote and then tomek links are used to form a good dataset",topic smoothening reduce noise one method smoothening moving averages method makes less noise helps detecting trend another method exponential moving averages mainly utilised time series weighted averages taken important handle missing values outliers applying moving averages techniques handle missing values winzorisation imputation trimming cap robust estimation saw importance scaling methods like normalisation standardisation boxcox methods euclidian distance models immune without scaling models assume normal distribution scenarios use boxcox scaling method standardisation normalisation doesnt change shape original distribution log transformation heteroscedasticity variance keeps changing across dataset log deemphasises large values later saw handle imbalance primarily occurs clustering problems three options 1 sample majority 2oversample minority duplication minority many times 3 produce synthetic first two methods naã¯ve usually recommended third method use smote method helps us synthesising new points minority class works euclidean distance method connects two minority points forms new point line uses knearest neighbours method scaled passing smote methods synthetic production adasyn borderlinesmote tomek links method sample majority class deletes majority points close border minority points usually smote tomek links form good dataset,173,9,12.381072,34.70387,9,0.8130393,7

432,"in today's class, we move on to data smoothening using moving averages. in the practical datasets, we see many fluctuations due to detrimental noise, which can lead to difficulties in obtaining trends and patterns in the dataset. to handle the missing values in the dataset, for example in stock analysis, we don't have data of the upcoming days but we can fill the data using moving averages. in the simple moving average(sma) method, we need to consider a window around the missing data point and average the values for this. you can select the points from both sides of the point in the window or points from the left side of the point. for points which are appearing after endpoints, we use the final endpoints more than once. after performing sma we can create the plot again, the plot will be refined based on the window size chosen by us. if we select a very large window size, the plot nearly becomes a straight line, so we need to choose the width of the window based on the data for better analysis. we also have better methods like exponential moving averages that weigh nearby samples than moving averages. if in a dataset one particular feature column's features have a larger magnitude compared to other features, then we apply normalization to this column, but due to this change only the coefficient of this column in the mlr model changes. clustering methods based on distance can be highly influenced if one column has larger magnitudes or more variance than others. then we saw the difference between normalization and standardization. in normalization, the data is transformed as xn=(x-xmin)/(xmax-xmin) while in standardization, the data is transformed to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 by the transformation 
zn=(x-mean)/(std. dev), in which the mean and std. dev. are of the sample. then we learned about the box-cox transformation, in which we transform the original x to remove the skewness from the data and remove the situation of heteroskedasticity, meaning the variance is changing in the data. it is based on the maximum likelihood estimation technique. then we saw the confusion matrix of a cluster plot in which a particular class was creating data imbalance. data imbalance means certain class shows more frequency than others, we need to handle this else we will get misleading results as an algorithm trained on imbalanced data may show biases toward a class. techniques handling data imbalance are either to undersample the majority class or oversample the minority class. a better approach is to generate synthetic data for the minority class(oversampling). we do this by performing a technique called smote in which we perform linear interpolation between existing samples. smote is used to oversample the minority class while the technique of tomek links on the other hand undersample the data. majority class samples with the nearest neighbours as minority class samples are removed from the data.",class move smoothening using moving averages practical datasets see many fluctuations due detrimental noise lead difficulties obtaining trends patterns dataset handle missing values dataset stock analysis dont upcoming days fill using moving averages simple moving averagesma method need consider window around missing point average values select points sides point window points left side point points appearing endpoints use final endpoints performing sma create plot plot refined based window size chosen us select large window size plot nearly becomes straight line need choose width window based analysis also methods like exponential moving averages weigh nearby samples moving averages dataset one particular feature columns features larger magnitude compared features apply normalization column due change coefficient column mlr model changes clustering methods based distance highly influenced one column larger magnitudes variance others saw difference normalization standardization normalization transformed xnxxminxmaxxmin standardization transformed mean 0 standard deviation 1 transformation znxmeanstd dev mean std dev sample learned boxcox transformation transform original x remove skewness remove situation heteroskedasticity meaning variance changing based maximum likelihood estimation technique saw confusion matrix cluster plot particular class creating imbalance imbalance means certain class shows frequency others need handle else get misleading results algorithm trained imbalanced may show biases toward class techniques handling imbalance either undersample majority class oversample minority class approach generate synthetic minority classoversampling performing technique called smote perform linear interpolation existing samples smote oversample minority class technique tomek links hand undersample majority class samples nearest neighbours minority class samples removed,241,9,10.3562355,36.3731,9,0.75231594,12
451,"we continued our discussions on eda. eda is the first step before performing any complex algorithms on the available data. it involves discovering problems associated with the data as well as few possibilities and insights from the data. in todayâ€™s class we looked at some specific problems associated with the raw data and the methods/ algorithms used to tackle these.
the first problem which we discussed was that of presence of lots of noise in the data, which causes hindrance in detecting the true signal. we discussed few methods to solve this problem. we specifically looked at /moving averages for data smootheningâ€™, in which we first learnt about the simple moving average. in this method, we take nearly about 50 data points surrounding a particular data point and evaluate their average inorder to get an average value associated with that particular point. we do the same with all the other points and finally get a smoother curve with the values as averages of some 50-60 points in the neighborhood. the smoothness of the curve depends on the number of data points we are choosing to evaluate the average. as we increase this number, the curve becomes smoother and smoother and eventually becomes a flat horizontal line, when all the points in the set are included in the window. this creates an â€˜artificial signalâ€™ and the original variations in the data vanish completely.  there can also be different ways in which we consider these points. for example, we may consider only those points which lie behind the selected point. this causes a problem at the end point, particularly the one on the left. similarly, we can also consider that window which includes some points behind the selected point and some ahead of it. this also causes problem at the end points. we can choose any of this, however our choice should be justifiable, according to the particular data set. 
next, we can also use exponential/ weighted averages, in which we assign higher weights to the points in the proximity. we must select an optimal size of window or the moving average method, such that we are able to extract the signal from the highly fluctuating values. 
before creating moving averages, we should address the problems of missing values and outliers, else they would cause trouble while creating the ma. 
the next problem is that some values in a column have significantly higher values than some others. this makes the gradient decent algorithm, more biased towards the larger values, thereby causing data imbalance and giving false results. hence, it is important to normalize the values in the columns so that every value lies between 0 and 1. standardization is another process wherein we convert the existing data into standard normal distributions, with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. both of these do not change the shape of the data. if we transform or scale the data, then any algorithm based on calculating euclidean distances would be largely affected. it is important to transform the data first because some algorithms assume that the data is already normally distributed. 
there is another kind of transformation- box cox transformation in which we evaluate the transformed value of each x by using a parameter lambda, which is optimized such that we get the closest approximation to the normally distributed data set. 
apart from transforming the features, we also have to reverse transform the transform the response variables, to get the values in the original form back. 
the third problem which we discussed was regarding the data imbalance, which occurs whenever we have a class whose number of samples are very small compared to the other classes. hence, the class is eventually suppressed by the others. we need to fix this problem, as we may get incorrect results/ predictions on using the imbalanced data. also, the algorithm may not learn well using the imbalanced data. 
to fix this data imbalance, we can do the following:
1)	under sample the majority class.
2)	over sample the minority class. the most naive method is to duplicate the values of the existing points.
3)	ideally, we should sample more points in the surrounding of these points by linearly interpolating between any two points. this is known as smote.
4)	next, instead of just randomly dropping any sample value from the majority class, we can drop those values which have the nearest sample belonging from the minor class. this has two advantages- first is that it creates a distinct boundary between the classes and also in this way we can get rid of some possibly misclassified points. this is known as tomek links.
5)	so, first we can apply smote then use tomek links to improve the quality of the classification model.

3) data preparation in these we select data, clean data, construct data, integrate and format data. after this we can infer which is dependent and independent variables. last three steps involved modelling, evaluation and deployment.
exploratory data analysis is an approach used in statistics and data science to analyze and investigate data sets. it involves statistical graphs and data visualization methods to visually represent the data. next we see that what are the problems associated with dependent and independent variables. in case of dependent variables problems such as not availability(remedy is that use unsupervised learning and create labels), incorrect, insufficient data( it includes very few observations or data imbalances) or too much data. and in  independent variables there can be problems within the column or between the column itself. heteroskedastic is that different variance exists throughout the entire datasets range. further ahead we explore types of missing data in the formats - 
1) missing completely at random 
2) missing at random 
3) missing not at random. so what do we do - 1) let them be n/a 
2) delete all instances with missing values 
3) or replace n/a values with a data statistics like mean or mode. mode value helps in categorical data. and multivariate data imputation can also be done. further we explore outliers which are the data points that differ significantly from the rest of data points. most of the models does not know how to handles this, but there are some models which can tackle this problem. how to detect these outliers we can do these either by univariate or multivariate methods. we calculate quartiles which divide a dataset into four equal parts, providing insights into data distribution. 
 1. first quartile (q1) â€“ 25% (lower quartile) - it represents the 25th percentile.
 2. second quartile (q2) â€“ it represents 50th percentile and median of the entire dataset.
 3. third quartile (q3) â€“ 75% (upper quartile)
 it represents the 75th percentile, meaning 75% of the data falls below this value.
standard deviation methods is similar. in case of multivariate we have dbscan which stands for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise. next we see that how to handles the outliers we can do these by data trimming and data capping. values that lies in the extremes arenâ€™t erroneous but they are called true outliers. example - stock prices can drastically shoot up or down, extreme weather events. one important note is that means are influenced by the outliers, median are not influenced by outliers. to get median data should be sorted first. combination of univariate columns many results in error.",todayâ€™s focus mainly exploratory analysis differentiate actual predicted values confusion matrices crispdm stands cross industry process mining 6 steps run cyclically 1 business understanding many steps including assessing situation assumption constraints risk 2data understanding collect initial explore also verify quality 3 preparation select clean construct integrate format infer dependent independent variables last three steps involved modelling evaluation deployment exploratory analysis approach statistics science analyze investigate sets involves statistical graphs visualization methods visually represent next see problems associated dependent independent variables case dependent variables problems availabilityremedy use unsupervised learning create labels incorrect insufficient includes observations imbalances much independent variables problems within column column heteroskedastic different variance exists throughout entire datasets range ahead explore types missing formats 1 missing completely random 2 missing random 3 missing random 1 let na 2 delete instances missing values 3 replace na values statistics like mean mode mode value helps categorical multivariate imputation also done explore outliers points differ significantly rest points models know handles models tackle problem detect outliers either univariate multivariate methods calculate quartiles divide dataset four equal parts providing insights distribution 1 first quartile q1 â€“ 25 lower quartile represents 25th percentile 2 second quartile q2 â€“ represents 50th percentile median entire dataset 3 third quartile q3 â€“ 75 upper quartile represents 75th percentile meaning 75 falls value standard deviation methods similar case multivariate dbscan stands densitybased spatial clustering applications noise next see handles outliers trimming capping values lies extremes arenâ€™t erroneous called true outliers stock prices drastically shoot extreme weather events one important note means influenced outliers median influenced outliers get median sorted first combination univariate columns many results error,268,10,3.4938593,31.414478,10,0.82948995,6

480,"in today's class, we discussed exploratory data analysis. crisp-dm is a widely used framework for data analysis. it has six steps that run cyclically: business understanding, which means knowing the domain, understanding the data, preparing data that is either transforming it, removing outliers, or adding missing data. then, we make the model using the data. then, we evaluate the model by applying it to the test data and checking its effectiveness. afterward, we think about what to do with the model and how to deploy it. eda uses statistical graphics and data visualization methods to represent the data. then we discussed doing the task during a particular duration is important, and having deadlines helps people to work accordingly. then we saw a mind map stating the methods when we know different situations about the dependent variable. then we applied eda to pima indians diabetes data, in which the outcome is either the person is diabetic(1) or not(0), we saw the histogram of each factor considered to get the outcome in which we see some were nearly normal, then we see the boxplot of these factors stating the variability in the data and outlier instances present in them, afterward we see their correlation coefficient with the outcome and we see a high correlation with glucose and age as more aged and people with more glucose level are prone to diabetes. we also see the scatter plots and matrix plots which shows more relation between the features, clusters are seen more visibly, but it can show the correlation between two factors only at a time. then we see the problem of class imbalance in which one class occurs more frequently than the other. we also see the india temperature data analysis, which majorly states that the temperatures are increasing as years pass for a particular time in a year, and also in a year, it first increases and then decreases. then we see about handling missing data values which are classified as: mcar- completely random data points missing, mar- some relationship between the missing data point and values in different columns, and mnar- the unobserved values themselves are responsible for the data being missed. we analyze the data and decide whether we need to add them or not, then we see that we have univariable data if we have just one column as independent variables and multivariable data if we have the combinations of such columns. then we handle the outliers by the median method and the standard deviation method, also we need to consider outliers sometimes as they have taken place and have an impact. among the quantile for outliers which are median and mean, the median is good as it is not influenced by outliers but the mean is impacted due to the outliers. at last, we saw that we just don't need to apply every technique to the data, we should get the domain knowledge, understand and analyze the data, and then perform the process of eda through the required and significant techniques.",class exploratory analysis crispdm widely framework analysis six steps run cyclically business understanding means knowing domain understanding preparing either transforming removing outliers adding missing make model using evaluate model applying test checking effectiveness afterward think model deploy eda uses statistical graphics visualization methods represent task particular duration important deadlines helps people work accordingly saw mind map stating methods know different situations dependent variable applied eda pima indians diabetes outcome either person diabetic1 not0 saw histogram factor considered get outcome see nearly normal see boxplot factors stating variability outlier instances present afterward see correlation coefficient outcome see high correlation glucose age aged people glucose level prone diabetes also see scatter plots matrix plots shows relation features clusters seen visibly show correlation two factors time see problem class imbalance one class occurs frequently also see india temperature analysis majorly states temperatures increasing years pass particular time year also year first increases decreases see handling missing values classified mcar completely random points missing mar relationship missing point values different columns mnar unobserved values responsible missed analyze decide whether need add see univariable one column independent variables multivariable combinations columns handle outliers median method standard deviation method also need consider outliers sometimes taken place impact among quantile outliers median mean median good influenced outliers mean impacted due outliers last saw dont need apply every technique get domain knowledge understand analyze perform process eda required significant techniques,232,10,3.7142239,32.230854,10,0.8099754,11

589,"data analysis begins with understanding the problem, which can be achieved through both visual and mathematical visualization. visual tools like scatter plots, histograms, and box plots help in identifying trends and patterns, while mathematical visualization through statistical summaries and correlation matrices provides deeper insights into data distributions. 
a structured approach to data mining follows the crisp-dm framework, which consists of six cyclical steps: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. during data exploration, heteroscedasticity (unequal variance of errors) and homoscedasticity (constant variance) must be examined, as heteroscedasticity can lead to unreliable models. another concern is multicollinearity, where highly correlated features can distort regression models. this can be addressed by removing variables, or using pca.

in today's session we focused on- data understanding and preparation
we tried to understand what quality of data is?

heteroscedasticity- when variance of errors is not constant

to begin with, one common eda technique is to plot histograms
one more technique is boxplot- helps us visualise outliers, basically what are the variations of the data
feature correlation- by a heat map
matrix plot- to show relations between the features 2 at a time
we should be wary that if a feature is dependent on more than one feature it may not be captured by the matrix plot or through boxplots

while looking at data, we also have to handle class imbalance

by observing past trends i can predict missing values; past data would tell us that the missing value would lie in a narrow band of possibility
there are 3 types of missing data- mcar, mar, mnar
so the question is- how to fix missig data??
-do nothing-  
-drop missing fields-
-inference from mean-
some things to give a thought about?
>> why focus on median rather than mean for detecting outliers: mean is influenced by outliers but the median is not
>> how is median calculated?
>> do not apply techniques blindly, just because they have been mentioned in class

141,"we discussed about how different methods represent the confusion matrix of the logistic regression, we can know columns by either going through the documentation of the particular python library or use the support values and the dataset columns. we looked the method data scientist's have come up with to work with the data, that is crisp-dm cross industry standard process for data mining there are six steps in this business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and deployment
in these data understanding and preparation are the key aspects. we learnt how important it is to do eda. we saw a mind map about what to do when we have different issues with the data mainly the problems are related to the data y and x values. we saw what techniques are used to tackle these problems like if there is class imbalance in dataset of classification problem etc. we looked the different eda methods like doing hypothesis, using box-plots to know the outliers , using heat maps to know the corelation among different features , matrix plot from this we can we get to know some nice clusters which are forming among the features together and their corelation with each other the problem is they give corelation between only two features at a time. next we saw about the missing values one there are three kinds of missing values mcar-missing completely at random, mar-missing at random(one of the sensor is faulty), mnar-missing not at random(like the co sensor is not designed to calculate the concentrations above 110). we can handle these through replacing the missing values using mean, median or mode where ever possible here is where the distribution of the particular feature is important to fill the missing values, we can also use ml model to particular feature to fill the missing values , backward and forward filling and interpolation techniques. outliers-finding can be done using iqr, probability of the data point lying within the 3 standard deviations from the mean of the feature, db scan for multivariate, we can also use t-sne plot to visualise the obtained outlier points of n-dimensions by projecting it on 2d plane. outlier-handling, dropping the column or row, data capping replacing outlier values with iqr upper and lower bounds is an example. if an outlier is true we can isolate it and treat it separately. mean if influenced by outliers but median is not",different methods represent confusion matrix logistic regression know columns either going documentation particular python library use support values dataset columns looked method scientists come work crispdm cross industry standard process mining six steps business understanding understanding preparation modelling evaluation deployment understanding preparation key aspects important eda saw mind map different issues mainly problems related x values saw techniques tackle problems like class imbalance dataset classification problem etc looked different eda methods like hypothesis using boxplots know outliers using heat maps know corelation among different features matrix plot get know nice clusters forming among features together corelation problem give corelation two features time next saw missing values one three kinds missing values mcarmissing completely random marmissing randomone sensor faulty mnarmissing randomlike co sensor designed calculate concentrations 110 handle replacing missing values using mean median mode ever possible distribution particular feature important fill missing values also use ml model particular feature fill missing values backward forward filling interpolation techniques outliersfinding done using iqr probability point lying within 3 standard deviations mean feature db scan multivariate also use tsne plot visualise obtained outlier points ndimensions projecting 2d plane outlierhandling dropping column row capping replacing outlier values iqr upper lower bounds outlier true isolate treat separately mean influenced outliers median,206,10,1.3171611,31.140213,10,0.7774305,24
183,"the class started off with the realisation that till now, we were working with good tailored data without any issues. however in real life, we almost never get any such data without any problems. much of the real life data has a lot of problems which need to be understood in order to solve the problems in the data and get some meaningful results. for this, we perform eda or exploratory data analysis on our data. our data could come in various formats like text, some files or some databases with large amounts of data present, and we might be exposed to non-tabular and non-numeric data. so we started off with a process for data mining, known as crisp - dm i.e. cross industry standard process for data mining. it has 6 steps which run cyclically, which includes business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and deployment of the model. business understanding involves defining business objectives, assess situations based on domain knowledge and understand the goals of the firm, while also understanding the constraints. also understand the success criteria and create a project plan as to how much time to allocate to different procedures. 
the major steps which we were focusing on were data understanding and data preparation. data understanding involves collection of data, describe and explore the data and also verify the quality of data which you have collected as to whether it has some useful insights to give or not. data preparation involves selection and cleaning of the data and construct the data into that which is good to work on. we further moved on to eda, which is a part of the data understanding step. 
eda involves performing some initial investigations on the data, and to gain some basic insights from it, and to spot anomalies, create and test hypothesis and check our assumptions. eda basically uses mathematical and visual statistical tools. we then went through a mind map pertaining to data problems. problems can be in the dependent or independent variable or both. we could have maybe no data about the dependent variable, or maybe insufficient or incorrect data, or maybe we could have too much data to handle. each of these problems have different solutions which involve sampling or generating data based on some theory. problems with independent variables involve having too many independent variables i.e. having multiple columns and having problems within the columns and also between columns. within columns we could have missing data, some distribution issues, heteroscadasticity i.e. varying variance across the data. between columns, we could have too few or too many features. 
eda is the first step in the data analysis pipeline, where we can get some insights like how features are distributed, what are the outliers, etc. a common eda technique involves plotting histograms and checking the distributions of each variable. then we plot box plots, which show us the amount of variability in the data, where the central line shows us the median value and the box around it shows the variations. anything outside the main boxes may be considered as outliers. we also plot some correlation heat maps to understand correlations between different variables. matrix plot is a 2-feature-each plot plotted in a matrix formation, which are used to find valuable insights, but are limited to two features at a time. some line plots can show some trends in the data, which can be useful to make certain predictions. 
we then moved on to handling missing values. there are multiple types of missing data. mcar - missing completely at random, mar - missing at random or mnar - missing not at random. mcar has completely random data points missing, mar has some relationship between the missing data points which could be due to resource, method of measurement, etc. mnar says that unobserved values are itself responsible for the data being missing. now when we have identified missing data, we could maybe ignore these missing points. but many algorithms donâ€™t know how to handle missing data, and information may be lost. we could also delete all the missing values, which could lead to data loss, but it is the easiest to do. another option could be to replace the missing values with some data statistic like the mean or the median. mode could be used for categorical data. sometimes instead of the data mean, we could use some of the values close to the missing data point in order to fill the place. we also have multi variate approaches, where we observe the other columns as well in order to fill our missing value. knn takes the mean of the nearest neighbour and fits the mean of the neighbouring values, while mice fits a linear predictor in order to fill in values based on a trend. time series data is special because we can use temporal judgement to fill the data. we can use interpolation methods to fill in points or use simple moving averages as well. 
we then talked about outliers which are data points that are signifcantly different from the rest of the observations. some algorithms are not very sensitive to outliers, while some are quite sensitive. we discussed about quartiles and the inter quartile range, which can be used to detect outliers. standard deviation can also be used for normally distributed data, where any data point beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean, can be classified as an outlier. for multi variate data, we have dbscan which is density based spatial clustering of applications with noise, where outliers are points which are not classified into any broad clusters of high density points. outliers also can be dealt with in many ways like removing them from the dataset, etc. true outliers are data points which are extreme values but they are not erreneous. for such outliers, we could make a separate set out of these and deal with the normal observations and the outliers separately.  for outliers, we use the median and not the mean as the mean is influenced by the outliers, while the median is not. also, for calculating the median, we sort the data first so that we get the correct metric. 
not all techniques are useful for all kinds of data. hence domain knowledge becomes important so as to know what techniques are best for us.

426,"this lecture addresses practical data analysis challenges, particularly those encountered when applying a trained model to new data, and introduces the ""curse of dimensionality.""

data distribution mismatch: the lecture begins by discussing exam performance with new data.  the model, trained on original data, performs poorly on the new data.  kernel density estimation (kde) plots reveal that the feature distributions differ significantly between the original and new datasets. this indicates the data were sampled from different populations, explaining the model's poor performance.

exploratory data analysis (eda): the lecture then moves to a solution walkthrough, starting with eda.  this involves:

missing value handling: identifying and addressing missing values using techniques like imputation (mean, median, etc.) or more advanced algorithms.
descriptive statistics: calculating and analyzing descriptive statistics (min, max, mean, median, etc.) for each feature.
outlier detection: using box plots to check for outliers. in this case, no outliers were found.
imbalanced data: analyzing the ""ailment"" (target variable) and finding it heavily imbalanced, specifically with very low counts for heart disease. this imbalance makes accurate prediction for heart disease extremely difficult. techniques like oversampling and undersampling are mentioned, but obtaining more data is suggested as the most effective solution.
kde plots: generating kde plots for all features to visualize and compare their distributions.
curse of dimensionality: the lecture then introduces the ""curse of dimensionality,"" which arises when the number of features in a dataset increases significantly. this leads to several problems:

increased sparsity: data points become more spread out, making it harder to find meaningful patterns.
increased complexity: model complexity increases, leading to potential overfitting.
increased computational cost: training and processing become more resource-intensive.
distance distortion: distances between data points become less meaningful, as they tend to become more uniform.
consequences and solutions: the consequences of high dimensionality include overfitting, increased computational resources, and data sparsity.

solutions to the curse of dimensionality include:

dimensionality reduction: techniques like principal component analysis (pca) to reduce the number of features.
feature selection: selecting the most relevant features.
regularization: techniques that penalize model complexity.
increasing the amount of data: more data can mitigate the effects of sparsity.",addresses practical analysis challenges particularly encountered applying trained model new introduces curse dimensionality distribution mismatch begins discussing exam performance new model trained original performs poorly new kernel density estimation kde plots reveal feature distributions differ significantly original new datasets indicates sampled different populations explaining models poor performance exploratory analysis eda moves solution walkthrough starting eda involves missing value handling identifying addressing missing values using techniques like imputation mean median etc advanced algorithms descriptive statistics calculating analyzing descriptive statistics min max mean median etc feature outlier detection using box plots check outliers case outliers found imbalanced analyzing ailment target variable finding heavily imbalanced specifically low counts heart disease imbalance makes accurate prediction heart disease extremely difficult techniques like oversampling undersampling mentioned obtaining suggested effective solution kde plots generating kde plots features visualize compare distributions curse dimensionality introduces curse dimensionality arises number features dataset increases significantly leads several problems increased sparsity points become spread making harder find meaningful patterns increased complexity model complexity increases leading potential overfitting increased computational cost training processing become resourceintensive distance distortion distances points become less meaningful tend become uniform consequences solutions consequences high dimensionality include overfitting increased computational resources sparsity solutions curse dimensionality include dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis pca reduce number features feature selection selecting relevant features regularization techniques penalize model complexity increasing amount mitigate effects sparsity,223,10,8.7942295,26.361404,10,0.7694257,27
412,"introduction to crisp-dm framework
the lecture provided a comprehensive guide to data analysis and problem-solving using the crisp-dm (cross-industry standard process for data mining) framework, which consists of six iterative steps: domain knowledge, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. it begins by emphasizing the importance of defining constraints, success criteria, and a project plan before diving into the data. the focus is on understanding the data, including identifying dependent variables (targets) and independent variables (features), and determining what problems can be solved with the available data.
classification of data problems
data problems are classified into two main categories: issues with dependent variables, such as missing labels (requiring clustering), incorrect or noisy labels (requiring noise removal), insufficient data (needing more data collection or synthetic data generation), or imbalanced data (requiring techniques like oversampling or undersampling); and issues with independent variables, such as within-column problems like missing values, outliers, incorrect representations, duplicates, uneven distributions, or too much data, and cross-column problems like insufficient features, too many features (requiring feature elimination using methods like p-values or heatmaps), or feature scaling issues.
exploratory data analysis (eda)
exploratory data analysis (eda) is a critical step, involving checking the distribution of variables, using box plots to understand variability, analyzing feature correlations with heatmaps, creating scatter plots and matrix plots to visualize relationships, identifying class imbalances and trends, and handling missing data by determining if itâ€™s mcar (missing completely at random), mar (missing at random), or mnar (missing not at random).
handling missing data
missing data can be addressed through methods like replacing with statistics (mean, median, etc.), using k-nearest neighbors or linear regression for imputation, or for time-series data, using interpolation or nearby values.
outlier detection and management
outlier detection involves techniques like sorting data and using the interquartile range (iqr) or standard deviation to identify outliers, applying dbscan clustering for multivariate outliers, or using t-sne to visualize high-dimensional data and spot anomalies. outliers can be true anomalies or errors, and true outliers may need to be processed separately. the lecture also highlighted the difference between univariate and multivariate analysis, where outliers may not be visible in one dimension but become apparent in multiple dimensions.
finally, it stresses the importance of iterative validation and thorough data preparation to ensure the data is clean and ready for modeling, leading to reliable and actionable insights.",introduction crispdm framework provided comprehensive guide analysis problemsolving using crispdm crossindustry standard process mining framework consists six iterative steps domain knowledge understanding preparation modeling evaluation deployment begins emphasizing importance defining constraints success criteria project plan diving focus understanding including identifying dependent variables targets independent variables features determining problems solved available classification problems problems classified two main categories issues dependent variables missing labels requiring clustering incorrect noisy labels requiring noise removal insufficient needing collection synthetic generation imbalanced requiring techniques like oversampling undersampling issues independent variables withincolumn problems like missing values outliers incorrect representations duplicates uneven distributions much crosscolumn problems like insufficient features many features requiring feature elimination using methods like pvalues heatmaps feature scaling issues exploratory analysis eda exploratory analysis eda critical step involving checking distribution variables using box plots understand variability analyzing feature correlations heatmaps creating scatter plots matrix plots visualize relationships identifying class imbalances trends handling missing determining itâ€™s mcar missing completely random mar missing random mnar missing random handling missing missing addressed methods like replacing statistics mean median etc using knearest neighbors linear regression imputation timeseries using interpolation nearby values outlier detection management outlier detection involves techniques like sorting using interquartile range iqr standard deviation identify outliers applying dbscan clustering multivariate outliers using tsne visualize highdimensional spot anomalies outliers true anomalies errors true outliers may need processed separately also highlighted difference univariate multivariate analysis outliers may visible one dimension become apparent multiple dimensions finally stresses importance iterative validation thorough preparation ensure clean ready modeling leading reliable actionable insights,250,10,2.559549,30.245653,10,0.76375043,28
607,"in the previous lecture, we discussed how to use a confusion matrix to evaluate the quality of results. itâ€™s important to verify whether the rows in the matrix represent actual or predicted values, as they can differ.

exploratory data analysis (eda) and crisp-dm
the crisp-dm (cross-industry standard process for data mining) methodology is broken down into six steps:

business understanding: define the objective, set goals, and plan.
data understanding: collect, describe, explore, and verify data quality.
data preparation: select, clean, construct, integrate, and format data.
modeling: choose techniques, design tests, build, and assess models.
evaluation: review results, evaluate the process, and plan next steps.
deployment: plan deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and report creation.
challenges in data
dependent variable (y): common problems include incorrect data (manual or automated checks), insufficient data (addressed by collecting more, simulating, or using undersampling/oversampling), and too much data (handled through sampling).
independent variable (x): issues include incorrect representation (solved by encoding), heteroskedasticity, insufficient features (resolved by feature engineering), too many features (dimensionality reduction), feature scaling problems (normalized via standardization), and collinearity (addressed through correlation analysis).
eda on pima indians diabetes dataset
box plots: help identify feature variability and outliers.
feature correlation: shows strong relationships between features.
matrix plots: highlight deeper relationships between features.
clusters and trends: identifying trends or clusters within data can show seasonality or recurring patterns.
handling missing data
types of missing data:

mcar: missing completely at random.
mar: missing at random (data missing due to external factors, e.g., sensor failure).
mnar: missing not at random (e.g., missing data because it exceeds a threshold).
methods to handle missing data:

delete instances: remove rows with missing data.
impute values: replace missing values with mean, median, etc.
multivariate imputation: use algorithms like k-nn or mice (multivariate imputation by chained equations) to predict missing values based on other data.
for time series data, missing values can be filled in with close temporal values, assuming small variations.

handling outliers
univariate outliers: identify outliers using the interquartile range (iqr), defined as q3 - q1. outliers fall outside the range of [q1 - 1.5iqr, q3 + 1.5iqr].

normal distribution method: points outside the normal distribution range can be considered outliers.

multivariate outliers: use density-based clustering methods (e.g., dbscan), where points with few nearby neighbors are treated as outliers.

handling outliers:

drop outliers: simply remove them from the dataset.
capping: apply limits to outlier values.

true outliers: some extreme values may not be erroneous and provide valuable insights and should be handled based on domain knowledge. such outliers should be treated independently and cautiously based on their impact on the model and their relationship with the data.",previous use confusion matrix evaluate quality results itâ€™s important verify whether rows matrix represent actual predicted values differ exploratory analysis eda crispdm crispdm crossindustry standard process mining methodology broken six steps business understanding define objective set goals plan understanding collect describe explore verify quality preparation select clean construct integrate format modeling choose techniques design tests build assess models evaluation review results evaluate process plan next steps deployment plan deployment monitoring maintenance report creation challenges dependent variable common problems include incorrect manual automated checks insufficient addressed collecting simulating using undersamplingoversampling much handled sampling independent variable x issues include incorrect representation solved encoding heteroskedasticity insufficient features resolved feature engineering many features dimensionality reduction feature scaling problems normalized via standardization collinearity addressed correlation analysis eda pima indians diabetes dataset box plots help identify feature variability outliers feature correlation shows strong relationships features matrix plots highlight deeper relationships features clusters trends identifying trends clusters within show seasonality recurring patterns handling missing types missing mcar missing completely random mar missing random missing due external factors eg sensor failure mnar missing random eg missing exceeds threshold methods handle missing delete instances remove rows missing impute values replace missing values mean median etc multivariate imputation use algorithms like knn mice multivariate imputation chained equations predict missing values based time series missing values filled close temporal values assuming small variations handling outliers univariate outliers identify outliers using interquartile range iqr defined q3 q1 outliers fall outside range q1 15iqr q3 15iqr normal distribution method points outside normal distribution range considered outliers multivariate outliers use densitybased clustering methods eg dbscan points nearby neighbors treated outliers handling outliers drop outliers simply remove dataset capping apply limits outlier values true outliers extreme values may erroneous provide valuable insights handled based domain knowledge outliers treated independently cautiously based impact model relationship,299,10,1.992707,30.393358,10,0.7606456,29
424,"in todays class (14/2/25)
we started with the discussion about the evaluation of confusion matric via dataframe function and scikit function where we found they both are transpose of each other and while calculating the recall and precision values, we need to understand which function we are using to find accurate values for which we can analyse the number of classes we have and estimate which of the matrix results in perfect number.
next up we stated with exploratory data analysis which helps us to understand the nature of data. the brief steps in data science includes 
1. problem understanding
2. eds
3. visualization
the 2 and 3 helps us to visualize and understand mathematics behind the data.
next up we answered the question what to do when you get the data using the crisp-dm 6 membered cycle
1. business/ domain understanding [determine the objectives/ hypothesis/ constraints, etc]
2. data understanding [describe the data in format/ columns/ rows/ missing data, etc]
3. dara preparation [perform the required transformation to use the data]
4. modelling
5. evaluation [using the metrics]
6. deployment
the main 4 uses of eda involves
1. get insights
2. spot anomalies
3. test hypothesis
4. check assumptions
it completes the following task using 2 techniques: statistical graphics and data visualization
than we gradually understood the importance of eda 
after which we entered to learning about missing values where we found 3 types
1. mcar (missing completely at random)
2. mar (missing at random): there is some relation between value and other feature due to which we can neglect them
3. mnar (missing not at random): it includes data which is not relevant based on the domain for example the co sensor above 110 should give a null value, we have no use for it and thus the sensor is set in the particular way
what can we do? --> drop/ let it be/ give a good number like mean or median these are univariate solutions while knns(average o nearest neighbors) / mice (train a function and predict the value for it) are the multi-variate solutions. for time-series data we can use forward/ backward fill/ linear interpolation (calculating the value by line connecting the alternate avalaible points)/ simple moving averages

625,"in this lecture we learnt about exploratory data analysis. this is the first step towards creating any machine learning model. eda involves cleaning, transforming, understanding and analyzing the raw data through basic and primary techniques. data can be analyzed to reveal patterns in it, if any. this can be done using either mathematical formulae or by making visual charts. also, many times we donâ€™t get a single data file, instead we have to merge a lot of files to get a compact, single data file on which we perform further analysis. 
there is crisp-dm: cross industry standard process for data mining, in which there are 6 steps to be followed for building a good ml model. 
the steps are:
1- business understanding- this involves acquiring domain knowledge, clearly defining our goal and objectives, and understanding the problems that are to be tackled by the model. 
2- data understanding- this step involves, collection, analysis, and assessment of the relevancy and quality of data.
3- data preparation- it involves cleaning and transforming data into suitable form for analysis. feature engineering is done to select the most relevant/ appropriate features.
4- modelling- after performing the data analysis and cleaning steps, we move towards fitting a basic model to our data. the model is trained based on the available data. if y-values are not available, we used unsupervised learning algorithms, to cluster the data and assign labels to it.
5- evaluation - assessment of the model performance using various metrics and implementing changes in it, if any.
6- deployment- implement the final model and monitor its performance to make improvements with time. also, effectively present the insights and results of our model.
the entire process is iterative, we need to repeat the steps again and again, as and when required.
we need to establish a certain acceptance criterion for our model. for many algorithms, we assume that the distribution of the features is normal, however this may not be the case for every x. heteroscedasticity is another problem, in which the variance of the residuals is not constant and keeps varying. 
in eda, we have to clean the data, account for the missing values and also detect the outliers and take necessary actions to handle these. 
the example we discussed in class was that of clustering patients into diabetic/ non-diabetic, by considering various features including, insulin levels, glucose levels, age, bmi, etc. these features, in the very basic step, can be analyzed using histograms, which may give us some (if not complete) idea about the distribution. we can also use correlation maps (heat maps) to find out the relation between these features. however, we cannot completely rely on these, and we should take into consideration numerous other factors as well. we looked upon matrix plot, box plots, quartile plots and some others to find the relationship in the data. the box plots, histograms can be used to detect outliers. 
it is important to know/ find out what we should do with the missing values and outliers. in some cases, it is reasonable to ignore the entire row/ observation and in some others, it is better to fill up the missing values. all this depends on the count of missing values. if there are a large number of such missing values, then completely deleting those observations, would leave us with merely 10-15 rows which is not at all sufficient to build up a model. 
for filling up the missing values we can use either mean, mode or median, depending on the level of measurement. for example, when we have nominal data, we use mode because the concept of mean is not defined for nominal data. 
the next step is to detect the outliers. there are several methods to do so. we can plot histograms, box plots and find out the points that lie far beyond the region where maximum of the points lie. dbscan- density based spatial clustering of applications with noise is yet another method used for detecting outliers. it considers a point and finds out other points around it which are in close proximity to it. likewise, it clusters all other points, thereby forming groups. the outliers remain ungrouped. 
median is not affected by the outliers, but the mean is. hence, median is preferred over mean for detecting outliers. however, in some cases, use of mean is not justifiable as it deviates largely from the values nearby the missing values. considering this as the approximate missing value would lead to larger errors. 
instead of using mean or median for filling the missing values, we can also use a regression model in that region and determine the missing values. so, even for filling the missing data and for data cleaning (eda), we use various models. this suggests that all the steps involved in building a model from the basic/ raw data are iterative and are performed in loops. 
by carrying out these repetitive operations we keep refining our model, so as to get the best possible model for our data set.

637,"in class we discussed the steps to be applied in data science, which are: understanding the problem, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. then we discussed about the cyclic running process called: crisp dm. it stands for ""cross industry standard process for data mining"". its six steps are: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, deployment. we need to budget our time accordingly as we do not want to spend too much time on unimportant tasks. we need to create a project plan to judicially assign time to each of these six steps. 
later, we looked into exploratory data analysis. we saw a rigorous mind map for problems related to 'x' and 'y'. for the x part, we saw that problems can be either less features or too many features. when we have too many features we can't just go on eliminating features. there is possibility that the feature we eliminate might actually be a controlling part for the process. hence, we need to be very careful. other problems are feature scaling problem, collinearity and multicollinearity. 
later, we had a presentation by shubham. he explained his approach on the data analysis for diabetic data. he explained the problems that arose and also their solutions. he suggested a method of density based spatial clustering of application with noise (dbscan).

for missing values, filling methods depend on the column's distribution, and techniques like mnar, mar, mcar, regression, and interpolation help. sir also highlighted box plots, matrix plots, and dbscan for outlier detection.
he introduced crisp-dm, a cyclical six-step process for data mining: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment. lastly, he stressed setting deadlines in ml work to avoid endless optimizations (he joked about ""asymptoting forever""). preprocessing is key before applying ml models!

506,"multi-class confusion matrix-
we started off with investigating the confusion matrix in multi-class classification. it is an important measure to gauge the performance of models by marking the correct predictions as well as the misclassifications across multiple classes, thus helping us identify where the model can be improved.

data understanding and preparation challenges-
much of the session was devoted to the issues involved in comprehending and preparing data, with a close look at problems concerning both the target variable (y) and feature variables (x).

issues with y:
  data unavailability: in case of missing target data, unsupervised learning methods can be employed.
  incorrect data: incorrect values need to be checked manually or automatically.
  not enough data: this requires collecting more data or simulating/generating it.
  too much data: dealing with too much data can involve statistical sampling, big data 
   techniques, or binning techniques.

issues with x:
  within columns: problems like inconsistent formatting and missing values.
  across columns: inter-feature relationships can cause redundancy or bias, necessitating 
   proper correlation analysis and suitable adjustments.


crisp-dm methodology-
the crisp-dm methodology was presented as a guide for data science projects. its six stagesâ€”business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deploymentâ€”ensure that each step, from setting objectives to deploying the final model, is methodically tackled.

exploratory data analysis (eda)-
eda was emphasized as an important process for summarizing data attributes and discovering patterns or trends. it plays a critical role in:
- developing insights into data
- detecting anomalies
- hypothesis testing

practical eda presentation-
our ta shared real-life examples with multiple datasets. one interesting example was the ""aqi readings for maharashtra"" dataset, where missing values were handled. methods like imputation with mean, median, or mode, and even more sophisticated model-based methods were proposed to efficiently handle missing data.

handling outliers-
detection and treatment of outliers were also covered in the session:
detection methods: techniques such as box plots, standard deviation analysis, dbscan, and isolation forest were illustrated.

we went back to the midsem correlation heat map, which at first glance seemed to have no significant relationships. but this was deceptive because of multicollinearity. to correct for this, we calculated râ² values between all pairs of features and applied variance inflation factor (vif) to conclude that only six features were actually independent, and others could be represented as linear combinations of these.
the lecture also touched on performance measures, the confusion matrix, and ta feedback on the e3 exercise. we wrapped up with a discussion of the curse of dimensionality, which occurs when there are too many features compared to available data, causing overfitting, sparsity growth, computational expense, and complexity. the solutions are either to grow data volume or to shrink feature dimensions.",class spent revisiting midsem exam saw insight analysis using kde plots range checks missing value imputation box plots outliers determined normalization needed touched upon recommendation oversample heart disease carried extreme class imbalance went back midsem correlation heat map first glance seemed significant relationships deceptive multicollinearity correct calculated râ² values pairs features applied variance inflation factor vif conclude six features actually independent others could represented linear combinations also touched performance measures confusion matrix ta feedback e3 exercise wrapped curse dimensionality occurs many features compared available causing overfitting sparsity growth computational expense complexity solutions either grow volume shrink feature dimensions,98,11,10.888759,20.861265,11,0.82167304,3

657,"in today's lecture, sir explained how we were supposed to approach midsem problem. we were required to essentially perform eda and then try to fit a classification model (note clustering was not required at all). in order to perform eda, we had first find missing value and then drop or replace it(dropping values was not a big deal as only 4 rows had missing values in 2000+ rows). we then had to plot box plot to detect outliers but there was no outlier. check if there was a need to normalise the data by checking the range of parameters.(large difference in range proposes a need for normalisation), plot scatter plots and histogram, and state descriptive statistics, generate heatmap of all the parameters (there was not much linear correlation between them, but there was possibility of multi-collinearity) count the number of cases of each ailment (heart diseasewas under represented); after all this, fitting a random forest classification model was required. then we had to plot kde plots for both the data set (q1 and q2) to see whether the distribution is same in both cases or not. the kde plots were not same and classification was not predicting the disease properly which suggests that the dataset were essentially of two different populations.

we spoke about several performance evaluation methods, such as the confusion matrix.  the curse of dimensionality is a phenomenon that occurs when analyzing data in high-dimensional spaces. it can impact the accuracy of models, the speed of algorithms, and the ability to distinguish between data points which was also talked about in the class.  increasing the dataset or using dimensionality reduction techniques to maximize feature selection are two potential solutions to this problem.

632,"midsem discussion:
we discussed about the questions that came up in midsems. the first question was all about exploratory data analysis (eda), we donâ€™t have to create an entire model as such, but we needed to analyze all the data that was given to understand what itâ€™s all about. stuff like, how many rows, how many columns, basics. and then we moved on to missing rows, in this case, since the number is very small, we could drop those rows. else, we could replace those with the mean of the data. this can only be done when data has no particular trend, and it has missing values. we observed a scatter plot to see that. then we saw the histogram as per each column. some are bimodal, some are unimodal, but those didnâ€™t give many insights. then we plotted a pie chart. also, we saw the heat correlation map, it shows a very ideal case, no correlation between the columns so we donâ€™t have to drop anything. however, this analysis is necessary, but not sufficient to say that the columns are not related. sometimes there might be a more serious problem of multi collinearity. 
for the second part of the question we learnt that the main reason why the model created wasnâ€™t working for the new data, was because it was for a different population. performing descriptive statistics on both the data side by side revealed this to us.
important points learnt:
â€¢	on any raw data, perform eda to get a complete understanding of data. 
â€¢	if the data is random, if there is no particular trend, only then you can replace the missing values with mean of the data. 
â€¢	if heat correlation map indicates correlation, it has correlation. but if it doesnâ€™t, then thatâ€™s not a good enough conclusion to say that the columns are not related. sometimes there might be a more serious problem of multi collinearity. so itâ€™s necessary, but not sufficient.

537,"in todayâ€™s class we spent our major time on discussing mid sem paper. we discussed about methods and procedures to be followed to solve the problems. the first step would be exploring dataset like the number of columns and rows, any missing values present or not. the second step would be data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, checking the descriptive statistics of dataset. if the data is random then replace missing values with statistics value. to find any outliers present in the dataset, we should create the box plot of each column. we would also see the distribution of â€œailmentsâ€ columns by creating bar chart, pie chart or any other plot. by creating this we would see that heart disease comes in very small count as compared to any other ailments. the best way to handle these problems is by looking manually on this. the scatter plot of columns should be created to see that the distribution is random or not. another plot we created is the heatmap which shows that columns are not correlated, but it is not sufficient. as there is correlation between some columns which can be checked by the variance inflation factor. for validation dataset, kde plot shows that the data is very different from that of training data.

it describes the problems that occur when the number of features in a dataset increases significantly. it arises when dealing with data in high-dimensional space. we can address this curse by
1. dimensionality reduction
2. increase the number of data points
3. feature selection 
4. regularisation

526,"at the start of class, sir discussed the midsem question paper. sir explained the question paper and shared the approach of solving the question and problems associated with it. 
first step is exploratory data analysis. we first try to find the missing values in the data. there were four rows with missing values. one way to solve this is to drop the four rows. we can justify it because we have 2371 rows. another way to solve it is to fill in the missing values. plotting the parameters, we noticed that there is randomness in the data. the histogram would show a normal distribution. this suggests that even if we replace the missing data with the mean it would be ok. before filling the value, we check the range of value of parameters to check if we need to do standardization or normalization. we find that for some parameters the range is very small while for some the range is really high. we still don't have visualization for outliers. for this we use the box-plots. we first use box plot on all the columns to check if any column is different. then we check for individual outliers (surprisingly there are no outliers). for the column with ailments, we use a bar-chart or pie-chart. we notice that heart-diseases is under-represented. one way is oversampling or under sampling. as the difference is very large for the under sampled data, we can conclude that the model would not be able to heart-disease properly. 
heatmap is the first step in finding the correlation between the columns. we notice that there is no correlation between the columns. the point is that doing pair-wise correlation is suicidal. we need additional steps to decide if there is any correlation between columns. the problem here is of multi-collinearity. we can use variance inflation factor analysis. 

when we have two entirely different samples, we try going for kde plots. after creating the kde plots, we notice that the distribution of each column is different for both the samples. this suggests that the model fitted on one sample cannot be used on the other sample. this means that both the samples come from different populations. 

by the end of the class we started with a new topic: the curse of dimensionality. too less data chasing too much features. we don't have enough data for representation of the columns. this is a problem when dealing with high dimensional data. this problem increases sparsity. this results in loss in the discriminative power of the model. the consequences are: overfitting (model stick to the given data and are not much reliable). for this we can try to reduce the number of features. we can do feature selection, regularization or increase the amount of data. these solutions are easier said than done. we checked for variance inflation factor. if a feature has a vif more than 10, then it can be expressed as a linear combination of other features. we can hence eliminate the features with vif greater than 10.

273,"the class started off by discussing the midsemester examination. we realised that ai tools do provide the right guidance, but if asked for complete solutions, they do suggest something completely off. we discussed that the test data for the prediction model had a completely different distribution as compared to the training data. we also had very few samples for one class which made our model unreliable for predicting that class. we concluded that the understanding of the data is very important for us to make efficient use of ai tools. we then moved forward and discussed about the class performance in assignment e3, and filled a survey about the midsem exam experience. 
till now, we had discussed problems within the same column. now we move on to problems across columns. we started discussion about a concept known as the curse of dimensionality. it describes the problems which occurs when the number of features in the dataset increases significantly. in that case, we get increased sparcity, increased complexity, increased computational cost and distance distortions. if data becomes sparse in an n dimensional space, the distance between the points increases a lot, and hence pattern detection in daya becomes difficult. to deal with this issue, we should try to decrease the dimensionality, or maybe we should select the most relevant features or use regularisation. we discussed about variance inflation factor, where a feature x_i is tried to be expressed as a function of the other features x_j (j not equal to i) and then the r^2 value of this model, is used to calculate the vif for a given feature. vif is given by 1 / (1 - r^2), which tells us that as the value of r^2 for a given feature expression increases, the vif also increases. we then say that if the vif for a given feature exceeds 10, the feature can be expressed as a linear combination of other features, and hence that feature is eliminated. this procedure is done for all such features which have larger vifs. one feature having a large vif is removed and then the procedure is re-run. on doing this repeatedly, we tend to reduce the dimension and also filter out the most independent features.

617,"we started off with discussion the right way to go about our midterm. so we basically had to go through eda and then comment on it by using a classifier model. major pointss are, looking for missing values, and decided whether to drop them or fill them. if we fill them what logic should be used. next we saw how one of the labels was very, very low, so then to represent it we either ask for more genuine data or let it be and get some wrong results. making copies is not the way around here. next was to find outliers, lucky our data didn't have any.  next was to see what happens when we fit it in a model. the the validation data part, we were to figure out why the model will predict bad here. so we can look at the features and compare them and it was inferred that the data was mostly from different samples.
next we had a small review of e3.

618,"in this class, we mainly discussed the midsem paper. sir showed us how we could have attempted the questions. the first part involved performing eda on the given data set to find out the missing values and outliers. the early exploratory stage involves creating scatter plots and histograms of distribution of the parameters to understand how they are distributed. next, to handle the missing values, we can either drop them completely or we can approximate them to some value. it depends on the trend in the data (which can be seen through the scatter plots), whether to use simple mean or some moving average. in this case, the data was randomly spread in the entire region, hence we could use the mean value of each column to fill the missing values. 
there can be mainly two types of problems- problem within the column, which involves missing values and the problem across the columns, which involves significant differences in the values of the parameters in the two columns. in such a normalization is required, to ensure that a particular class is not under-expressed/ suppressed by the others.
box plots give us idea about the outliers. in this case, there werenâ€™t any outliers.
we can visualize the categorical data using bar charts/ pie charts.
 correlation heat maps can also be used to check for the relations between the different parameters. the problem with this is that it only checks for the correlation between a feature and only one other feature at a time. however, it is possible that a feature depends on multiple other features and is a linear combination of those. correlation maps do not provide this information. hence, they are sufficient but not necessary check of correlation.
for solving this problem, we use â€˜variance inflation factorâ€™(vif). it compares each feature with all other features taken together. to find out the vif, we express each feature as a linear combination of the others and fit a regression model on it. we then find the r2 values for each of the feature. vif is then calculated as 1/(1-r2). so, as r2 increases, vif also increases. hence, if r2 values is high, it indicates strong correlation among the features.
if vif of a feature is >10 then that feature can be expressed as a linear combination of the others, hence we remove that feature column from our data.
in this way, we reduce the dimensionality of the data set, as high dimensionality is a curse. it spreads out the data more, thereby making it difficult to find out important patterns from the data.
the next part in the question was to check whether the derived regression model worked well for another different data set as well. by plotting kde plots and analyzing the descriptive statistics of the new data set, we observed that it had completely different distribution than the original data set, which suggested that it belonged to a completely different population. this was also evident by the looking at the values of accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores of the model, fitted to the new data. hence, the original model did not work well for the new data, which belonged to a different population.

109,"approach to solving the midsem question paper
to systematically analyze the given problem, we followed a structured approach, starting with exploratory data analysis (eda). this involved examining the dataset for missing values, identifying key statistical measures such as the range, mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and count, and understanding the overall distribution of the data.

upon detecting missing values, we explored various imputation strategies. given that the number of missing values was small, we opted to drop them. however, alternative approaches such as replacing them with the mean, median, or using linear interpolation could also be employed in other scenarios.

since the dataset primarily contained categorical features, we aimed to build a prediction model to classify ailments based on blood test results. to assess the interdependence among the features, we applied principal component analysis (pca) and visualized correlations using a heatmap of pairwise components. while the heatmap did not indicate significant correlation, it only accounted for pairwise relationships. to check for multicollinearity among multiple features, we computed the variance inflation factor (vif) by fitting regression models for each feature against all others and analyzing the râ² values.

given the presence of outliers and the nature of the data, we chose a tree-based model, specifically random forest, due to its robustness in handling non-linearity and outliers. since the dataset exhibited a large difference between minimum and maximum values, we applied normalization before feeding it into the model.

further analysis of the frequency distribution of categorical values revealed a significant class imbalance, with the heart disease class being heavily underrepresented. as expected, this imbalance led to poor classification performance, as reflected in the confusion matrix.

to validate our modelâ€™s generalizability, we applied the same analysis to another dataset. the results showed that the model did not fit well, suggesting that the two datasets were likely drawn from different underlying populations.

through this systematic process, we were able to derive key insights about data preprocessing, feature relationships, and model performance, emphasizing the importance of handling missing values, normalization, and addressing class imbalances in classification tasks.",approach solving midsem question paper systematically analyze given problem followed structured approach starting exploratory analysis eda involved examining dataset missing values identifying key statistical measures range mean median 25th 75th percentiles count understanding overall distribution upon detecting missing values explored imputation strategies given number missing values small opted drop however alternative approaches replacing mean median using linear interpolation could also employed scenarios since dataset primarily contained categorical features aimed build prediction model classify ailments based blood test results assess interdependence among features applied principal component analysis pca visualized correlations using heatmap pairwise components heatmap indicate significant correlation accounted pairwise relationships check multicollinearity among multiple features computed variance inflation factor vif fitting regression models feature others analyzing râ² values given presence outliers nature chose treebased model specifically random forest due robustness handling nonlinearity outliers since dataset exhibited large difference minimum maximum values applied normalization feeding model analysis frequency distribution categorical values revealed significant class imbalance heart disease class heavily underrepresented expected imbalance led poor classification performance reflected confusion matrix validate modelâ€™s generalizability applied analysis another dataset results showed model fit well suggesting two datasets likely drawn different underlying populations systematic process able derive key insights preprocessing feature relationships model performance emphasizing importance handling missing values normalization addressing class imbalances classification tasks,210,10,10.446174,23.487658,11,0.67732084,25
167,"the session started with a recap of the mid-semester exam, emphasizing problem-solving strategies and methods to address various kinds of questions efficiently. this served to reinforce important concepts and enhance analytical thinking for similar problems in the future.

next, the discussion covered the primary steps involved in exploratory data analysis (eda). this included data visualization techniques such as histograms and heat maps, which help in understanding data distributions and correlations. additionally, handling missing values was discussed, emphasizing methods like imputation or dropping missing data based on context.

one of the major challenges with the dataset was the under-sampling of the target class, ""heart diseases."" imbalance in this form can severely influence prediction accuracy, causing the model to become biased. the drawback of using an imbalanced dataset was discussed, as well as possible remedies in the form of resampling techniques or utilizing correct evaluation measures like precision-recall curves.

feature transformation and selection were also investigated. the conditions under which columns were to be dropped were described, such as when features were highly collinear or had minimal variance. feature scaling was highlighted as important, especially for models that are sensitive to feature magnitude, like support vector machines (svm) and logistic regression.

model selection was informed by data type and problem. tree models, svm, and logistic regression were the contenders as viable candidates. the pros and cons of each model were assessed based on the characteristics of the dataset, making an informed decision.

lastly, the curse of dimensionality was discussed, meaning the issues that arise from dealing with high-dimensional data, including overfitting and higher computational costs. the variance inflation factor (vif) was identified as a metric for the detection of multicollinearity to assist in feature selection and enhancing model performance.",started recap midsemester exam emphasizing problemsolving strategies methods address kinds questions efficiently served reinforce important concepts enhance analytical thinking similar problems future next covered primary steps involved exploratory analysis eda included visualization techniques histograms heat maps help understanding distributions correlations additionally handling missing values emphasizing methods like imputation dropping missing based context one major challenges dataset undersampling target class heart diseases imbalance form severely influence prediction accuracy causing model become biased drawback using imbalanced dataset well possible remedies form resampling techniques utilizing correct evaluation measures like precisionrecall curves feature transformation selection also investigated conditions columns dropped described features highly collinear minimal variance feature scaling highlighted important especially models sensitive feature magnitude like support vector machines svm logistic regression model selection informed type problem tree models svm logistic regression contenders viable candidates pros cons model assessed based characteristics dataset making informed decision lastly curse dimensionality meaning issues arise dealing highdimensional including overfitting higher computational costs variance inflation factor vif identified metric detection multicollinearity assist feature selection enhancing model performance,168,10,9.5381365,25.399155,11,0.6745763,26

241,"in the starting, we gave a look at both parts of the problem statement and understood that chatgpt is good for the coding part but not for designing the solution. we started off with the eda and made scatter plots and histograms. by looking into it, we realized the need for normalisation. then to check outliers, we made boxplots. it was very surprising to see that there were no outliers in any boxplot. to understand the representation of each ailment, we made a bar graph or pie chart. we came to know that heart diseases are very under-represented. as a result, we can say that we can't give our analysis on heart diseases because undersampling leads to loss of information while oversampling will not be accurate, so it is better to drop heart disease ailment.
we then made a heatmap to understand the correlations between parameters. we used random forest model for regression. by looking into the confusion matrix, we saw it gave a nice result except for heart disease.

387,"today's class, midsem paper was discussed. the following are the key take aways that i got:
1. in the case of multivariable dataset, checking for correlation between only two variables alone is not sufficient. one must look for any correlation between a variable and the linear combination of the rest as well. thus one fits a linear regression between them, gets the r^2 value and finds a metric called variance inflation factor. we can set a threshold for this metric(say around 8). one can conclude that the variable has a strong correlation with the linear combination of other variables. thus one may consider excluding that variable from the dataset. as one keeps doing this one by one, until only those variables with vif less than a threshold are present, one can reduce the number of independent variables in our dataset.
2. every step of data-analysis must be supported then and there by clear thinking and reasoning. one must be able to justify all the assumptions and steps in their workflow.
3. learnt that in cases where a class is under-represented in the training dataset, if the difference between the support of that class and an another is very huge, it is ok to drop the class for model creation. undersampling majority class means, one is giving too few samples to the model=> weak training, oversampling minority ones also won't make up meaningful data.
4. the concept of dimensionality reduction: some datasets have large number of variables. this has certain disadvantages. more variables means, the complex will be the pattern between them. if as many data is not available to capture the complexity, the output of the training will not be appreciable. some of the solutions to handle this issue are dimensionality reduction, feature selection, regularization and trying to increase the data in hand.",class midsem paper following key take aways got 1 case multivariable dataset checking correlation two variables alone sufficient one must look correlation variable linear combination rest well thus one fits linear regression gets r2 value finds metric called variance inflation factor set threshold metricsay around 8 one conclude variable strong correlation linear combination variables thus one may consider excluding variable dataset one keeps one one variables vif less threshold present one reduce number independent variables dataset 2 every step dataanalysis must supported clear thinking reasoning one must able justify assumptions steps workflow 3 cases class underrepresented training dataset difference support class another huge ok drop class model creation undersampling majority class means one giving samples model weak training oversampling minority ones also wont make meaningful 4 concept dimensionality reduction datasets large number variables certain disadvantages variables means complex pattern many available capture complexity output training appreciable solutions handle issue dimensionality reduction feature selection regularization trying increase hand,157,11,11.71075,17.61749,11,0.6489258,29
355,"in today's class we discussed the midsem paper and e3 assignment that was given before. apart from that we discussed about the curse of dimensionality and variance inflation factor (vif) in machine learning.

curse of dimensionality: as the number of features in a dataset increases, data points become more spread out, making pattern recognition harder. this also leads to more complex models, higher computational costs, and difficulty in measuring distances between points.

variance inflation factor (vif): we discussed how vif helps detect multicollinearity, which occurs when features in a dataset are highly correlated. high multicollinearity can make a model unstable and reduce its reliability.

518,"in today's class, we mainly discussed our mid-semester test. we first analyzed the data, which has 24 columns of blood parameters, 1 ailment column, and 2371 rows, providing information about the population residing in an area. based on blood samples taken, we identified whether they are healthy or have certain types of disease. we gave an open test so that we can use tools, but do not rely on them so much that they will solve the problem effectively like an expert. in the test, we can get solutions through multiple paths, we need to take one and justify it. based on the nature of the data, define what kind of problem you are going to solve. in the test, a simple classification model was needed, and we also needed to create a model and state why it is not working on the validation dataset. also, as per vp's choice, we should have made kde, not histogram. heading towards the solution, we must report missing values, either not consider them in model training or replace them with some values. for this, we need to know about the trend/distribution of the data, for this we can plot a scatter plot of all the columns, which shows the data was all over the plot, as there was no time series in the question, and hence randomness was there in the data. the histogram should be normal. we can use the mean to fix the missing values in certain cases only, but not always. then we need to consider the range of values across the columns, do we need to normalize or standardize the data, for this we plotted the histogram of all the blood parameters, in them some were unimodal, some were bimodal, and not normal and hence we do not get anything from these but these will be helpful when comparing with new dataset. we then see the descriptive statistics for the parameters and also compare with the validation data statistics and plots. at the minimum, we should get the data normalized between 0 and 1, hence we should have applied normalization on the datasets at least. we also see the box plot of numerical data, in which we see one column that was higher than others, hence the need for normalization is there. we also get to know about outliers through the columns and saw that there were no outliers in the columns. then we analyzed the ailment column using a bar chart, which can be made through a pivot table or counting in excel, and also through python. the heart disease population was much less compared to others, and thrombocytosis was also less than another disease in the initial dataset. hence, the model will not identify heart disease effectively and needs more data of these in the dataset for a better model. we plotted a simple correlation heatmap, which tells us that the columns are not correlated much and is good for us. we also discussed that tree-based models are good for modelling such kinds of data. then we split the dataset into test and train data (20% and 80%). we applied the random forest model on the data, and we saw that there was no misclassification for other diseases except heart diseases. then we looked at the confusion matrix of the validation data, which was not very good compared to the original dataset given. then we perform the distribution analysis to see why the model performed badly on the validation dataset. in that, we compare the plots of the original and validation dataset, which majorly shows the distributions are different for the datasets, which at last states that the data are from different populations and training the model on one will not perform well on the other. then we get the

83,"the session began with a discussion on the mid-semester exam, where the professor went over the solutions, clarifying key concepts and addressing doubts. this was followed by the ta providing feedback on the exercise, highlighting common mistakes and areas for improvement. after these discussions, the professor moved on to teaching two important topics in machine learning and statistics.

the first topic covered was the variance inflation factor (vif), a measure used to detect multicollinearity in regression models. the professor explained that vif is defined as  represents the coefficient of determination obtained by regressing a feature on all other features. a high vif value indicates strong collinearity, which can negatively impact model performance by making coefficient estimates unreliable. understanding vif is crucial in regression analysis to ensure that independent variables are not excessively correlated.

the second topic discussed was the curse of dimensionality, a fundamental challenge in machine learning that arises when working with high-dimensional data. the professor explained that as the number of dimensions increases, data points become more sparse, making it harder to identify meaningful patterns. additionally, high-dimensional datasets increase model complexity, often leading to overfitting and poor generalization to new data. the computational cost of processing such datasets also rises significantly, requiring more time and resources. another major issue is distance distortion, where the concept of ""distance"" between data points becomes less meaningful, making it difficult to distinguish between nearest and farthest neighbors. the session emphasized the importance of addressing these challenges through techniques like feature selection and dimensionality reduction to improve model efficiency and accuracy.",began midsemester exam professor went solutions clarifying key concepts addressing doubts followed ta providing feedback exercise highlighting common mistakes areas improvement discussions professor moved teaching two important topics machine learning statistics first topic covered variance inflation factor vif measure detect multicollinearity regression models professor explained vif defined represents coefficient determination obtained regressing feature features high vif value indicates strong collinearity negatively impact model performance making coefficient estimates unreliable understanding vif crucial regression analysis ensure independent variables excessively correlated second topic curse dimensionality fundamental challenge machine learning arises working highdimensional professor explained number dimensions increases points become sparse making harder identify meaningful patterns additionally highdimensional datasets increase model complexity often leading overfitting poor generalization new computational cost processing datasets also rises significantly requiring time resources another major issue distance distortion concept distance points becomes less meaningful making difficult distinguish nearest farthest neighbors emphasized importance addressing challenges techniques like feature selection dimensionality reduction improve model efficiency accuracy,155,11,12.837562,18.271158,11,0.58144134,34

491,"in this session, we covered methods of analyzing and condensing high-dimensional data without sacrificing interpretability. we started by talking about heatmaps, which, while perhaps not showing all the minute variations, are well worth it to compare several parameters at once. heatmaps facilitate rapid pairwise comparisons that would be difficult to view individually, thus serving as an effective tool when performing exploratory data analysis (eda).

the variance inflation factor (vif) was subsequently developed as a multicollinearity diagnostic. vif measures the extent to which a particular parameter is accounted for by the other parameters in the data. for any feature, a large vif means that the feature is strongly redundant with others. if a feature's vif is greater than some chosen threshold, it should be eliminated to prevent multicollinearityâ€”a problem that is frequently more important than the requirement for dimensionality reduction through pca.

principal component analysis (pca) was explained as a technique that employs singular value decomposition to project data onto new, mutually orthogonal components. the principal components cover the original dataset's complete dimensionality, yet you can opt to keep only the most important ones in order to bring down the dimensionality. the kept components are weighted sums of the original features, whose weights are referred to as loadings. although pca is ideal for prediction, visualization in the context of eda, and data compression capturing the largest amount of variance, it is less ideal for ""what if"" or sensitivity analysis because the transformed components do not map directly onto the original parameters. in addition, pca is sensitive to scaling of the data, so normalization is necessary.

by contrast, t-sne employs a t-distribution and stochastic gradient descent to create a low-dimensional lossy representation of high-dimensional data. while giving up on precise distances, t-sne performs very well on preserving the relative proximity of the data points, and thus is very effective for visualizing clusters and intricate patterns.",covered methods analyzing condensing highdimensional without sacrificing interpretability started talking heatmaps perhaps showing minute variations well worth compare several parameters heatmaps facilitate rapid pairwise comparisons would difficult view individually thus serving effective tool performing exploratory analysis eda variance inflation factor vif subsequently developed multicollinearity diagnostic vif measures extent particular parameter accounted parameters feature large vif means feature strongly redundant others features vif greater chosen threshold eliminated prevent multicollinearityâ€”a problem frequently important requirement dimensionality reduction pca principal component analysis pca explained technique employs singular value decomposition project onto new mutually orthogonal components principal components cover original datasets complete dimensionality yet opt keep important ones order bring dimensionality kept components weighted sums original features whose weights referred loadings although pca ideal prediction visualization context eda compression capturing largest amount variance less ideal sensitivity analysis transformed components map directly onto original parameters addition pca sensitive scaling normalization necessary contrast tsne employs tdistribution stochastic gradient descent create lowdimensional lossy representation highdimensional giving precise distances tsne performs well preserving relative proximity points thus effective visualizing clusters intricate patterns,173,12,17.310925,16.504637,12,0.8947246,1
640,"we started a new topic vif which is used to determine the most important and unique parameters. in vif vs r squared graph, we fix a vif threshold corresponding to r squared = 0.9 and reject the parameters having vif greater than the threshold value. we start eliminating features one by one such that there are no features with vif greater than say 10. our motivation for reducing the features is to minimize the curse of dimensionality. we then looked at principal component analysis which is an application of single value decomposition. it also works similar to vif by reducing dimensionality. the remaining components are known as principal components. principal components are always orthogonal to each other. the essential difference vif and pca are the parameters which they test. we generally perform vif first as it increases the interpretability. vif is useful for making predictions and pca is more useful for ""what if"" analysis or delta analysis. the uses of pca include dimension reduction, making prediction model and visualisation which is done in eda stage. the thing to be cautious about is the scale dependency of pca and some parameters might need normalisation. we then concluded the lecture with discussion on tsne.

principal component analysis (pca)

512,"todayâ€™s discussion is mainly based on principal component analysis and t-sne. vif is used to detect multicollinearity by calculating how much the variance of a regression coefficient increases. so, the highest vif values indicates that the column in very dependent on others. in these we set a threshold and column having vif value higher than that will be drop out. 
having too many features in data can cause problems like overfitting, slower computation, and lower accuracy. this is called the curse of dimensionality where more features exponentially increase the data needed for reliable results. to tackle this problem we use dimensionality reduction in which we reduces the number of features. pca is one of the methods to do it. it works by transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while maximizing the variance.
we create principal components which is the new axis where the data is most spread out. pcs are orthogonal to each others. the number of pcs are equal to the number of dimensions we have. pc1 are that axis which captures best variance in data. the general equation of principal components is pc1=c1x1 + c2x2 + c3x3 + c4x4 + .... where c1 is called loadings. predictions can be made through pca but we loses explain ability i.e. we can explain the results. principal component analysis have many features like data reduction, dimension reduction, prediction models, visualization (understanding the structure of data).
pca is sensitive to the data scale, we have to normalize the data before applying pca. we have seen an example on mnist dataset consists of handwritten digits. another method we learn is t-sne which stands for t-distribution stochastic neighbor encoding. it is a lossy transformation. it helps us to map multi-dimensional data to 2 dimensions or 3 dimensions.",todayâ€™s mainly based principal component analysis tsne vif detect multicollinearity calculating much variance regression coefficient increases highest vif values indicates column dependent others set threshold column vif value higher drop many features cause problems like overfitting slower computation lower accuracy called curse dimensionality features exponentially increase needed reliable results tackle problem use dimensionality reduction reduces number features pca one methods works transforming highdimensional lowerdimensional space maximizing variance create principal components new axis spread pcs orthogonal others number pcs equal number dimensions pc1 axis captures best variance general equation principal components pc1c1x1 c2x2 c3x3 c4x4 c1 called loadings predictions made pca loses explain ability ie explain results principal component analysis many features like reduction dimension reduction prediction models visualization understanding structure pca sensitive scale normalize applying pca seen mnist dataset consists handwritten digits another method learn tsne stands tdistribution stochastic neighbor encoding lossy transformation helps us map multidimensional 2 dimensions 3 dimensions,151,12,17.792385,15.314308,12,0.8891696,4
401,"in this session, we explored the variance inflation factor (vif) and principal component analysis (pca), focusing on their applications, differences, and use cases.

variance inflation factor (vif):

used to detect multicollinearity among features.
computed as 
vif=1/1-r^2, where r^2 is obtained by regressing a feature against all others.
a vif threshold of 10 (corresponding to r^2 = 0.9) is commonly used for feature elimination.
preserves real-world features, making it suitable for sensitivity analysis and interpretability in models.

principal component analysis (pca):

transforms features into new uncorrelated components (pcs) ranked by variance.
pc1 > pc2 > pc3 in terms of variance captured, with a decreasing trend in the explained variance graph.
common applications include dimensionality reduction, data visualization (e.g., pc1 vs. pc2 plots), and prediction modeling.
requires normalization to ensure fair variance contribution from all features.
unlike vif, pca does not retain original features, making sensitivity analysis difficult.

comparison:

vif works in feature space, removing redundant variables while keeping real-world interpretability.
pca creates mathematical features, making it more suitable for dimensionality reduction rather than feature selection.
vif is often preferred over pca when feature interpretability is essential.

additionally, the emnist dataset was mentioned as an example for handwritten digit classification using pca.

t-sne:  t-sne is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique primarily used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space (typically 2d or 3d). 

how t-sne works:
measures similarity in high dimensions:
computes the probability that two points are neighbors in the original high-dimensional space using a gaussian distribution.
maps data to lower dimensions:
assigns similar points in a lower-dimensional space using a studentâ€™s t-distribution, ensuring that points that were close in high-dimensional space remain close.
optimizes for local structure:
unlike pca (which captures global variance), t-sne preserves local neighborhoods, making it great for cluster visualization.",explored variance inflation factor vif principal component analysis pca focusing applications differences use cases variance inflation factor vif detect multicollinearity among features computed vif11r2 r2 obtained regressing feature others vif threshold 10 corresponding r2 09 commonly feature elimination preserves realworld features making suitable sensitivity analysis interpretability models principal component analysis pca transforms features new uncorrelated components pcs ranked variance pc1 pc2 pc3 terms variance captured decreasing trend explained variance graph common applications include dimensionality reduction visualization eg pc1 vs pc2 plots prediction modeling requires normalization ensure fair variance contribution features unlike vif pca retain original features making sensitivity analysis difficult comparison vif works feature space removing redundant variables keeping realworld interpretability pca creates mathematical features making suitable dimensionality reduction rather feature selection vif often preferred pca feature interpretability essential additionally emnist dataset mentioned handwritten digit classification using pca tsne tsne nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique primarily visualizing highdimensional lowerdimensional space typically 2d 3d tsne works measures similarity high dimensions computes probability two points neighbors original highdimensional space using gaussian distribution maps lower dimensions assigns similar points lowerdimensional space using studentâ€™s tdistribution ensuring points close highdimensional space remain close optimizes local structure unlike pca captures global variance tsne preserves local neighborhoods making great cluster visualization,203,12,16.52852,17.243458,12,0.88692296,5

547,"we first did a comparative study
 between features and r-squared where we want to reduce the number of features because of the difficulty presented by dimensionality.
principal component analysis (pca) uses singular value decomposition (svd). in a data set with variables x1 and x2, it is feasible to obtain as many principal components (pcs) as the number of dimensions, i.e., pc_1 and pc_2, which are orthogonal to each other. the direction of these principal component axes is so oriented that the first component explains the maximum variability, and the next components explain successively less variability. at first, this is a two-dimensional problem, and pca successfully simplifies it into one dimension.  pca reduces the dimension of the data set. it is necessary to calculate the variance inflation factor (vif) before pca is applied. while principal components increase predictive power, their interpretability is severely compromised. ""what-if"" analyses are not possible with principal components since they are not real features but mathematical entities used for prediction. therefore, tracing predictions back to the original variables is compromised when pca is used.
pca is also used in exploratory data analysis (eda), which dictates the choice between going for ordinary regression or pca regression.
limitations of pca are its interpretative difficulties. but one strong point is that it can be used to visualize large datasets because the original data, which might have many dimensions (columns), can be reduced very much using the corresponding principal components.
another well-known dimensionality reduction method is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne), which compares t-distribution with gaussian normal distribution. t-sne is a probabilistic method.
the process of converting raw data to labeled data through t-sne is achieved by developing a probability distribution for every data point that reflects its closeness to all other points in the dataset. in high-dimensional spaces, gaussian normal distribution is used, while t-distribution is used in low-dimensional situations. the probability of a point being close to another is highlighted in t-sne over its gaussian equivalent.",first comparative study features rsquared want reduce number features difficulty presented dimensionality principal component analysis pca uses singular value decomposition svd set variables x1 x2 feasible obtain many principal components pcs number dimensions ie pc1 pc2 orthogonal direction principal component axes oriented first component explains maximum variability next components explain successively less variability first twodimensional problem pca successfully simplifies one dimension pca reduces dimension set necessary calculate variance inflation factor vif pca applied principal components increase predictive power interpretability severely compromised whatif analyses possible principal components since real features mathematical entities prediction therefore tracing predictions back original variables compromised pca pca also exploratory analysis eda dictates choice going ordinary regression pca regression limitations pca interpretative difficulties one strong point visualize large datasets original might many dimensions columns reduced much using corresponding principal components another wellknown dimensionality reduction method tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tsne compares tdistribution gaussian normal distribution tsne probabilistic method process converting raw labeled tsne achieved developing probability distribution every point reflects closeness points dataset highdimensional spaces gaussian normal distribution tdistribution lowdimensional situations probability point close another highlighted tsne gaussian equivalent,182,12,16.97486,15.806436,12,0.8743833,7

449,"we want to minimize the number of features to counteract the curse of dimensionality. variance inflation factor (vif) assists in identifying multicollinearity between independent variables and needs to be run prior to principal component analysis (pca), as pca does not eliminate redundancy but projects the feature space. r-square quantifies the amount of variance explained by the model but does not reveal multicollinearity. there is a compromise between the number of features and r-squareâ€”increasing the number of features can increase r-square but at the cost of instability. pca, which is an application of singular value decomposition (svd), is a dimensionality reduction technique that creates principal components (pcs) that are orthogonal and ordered by variance explained. the first pc explains the most variance, followed by the rest of the pcs. this conversion enables dimensionality reduction of a multi-dimensional data set to fewer dimensions (e.g., reducing a 2d problem to 1d). pca, however, diminishes interpretability, as ""what-if"" analysis is not possible because pcs are mathematical abstractions and not actual features.it is mostly used for dimensionality reduction, predictive modeling, and visualization in exploratory data analysis (eda) to decide between ordinary regression and pca regression. while pca is good at reducing high-dimensional data, it is at the expense of interpretability as it complicates the linking of predictions to original variables. another dimensionality reduction method, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne), differs from pca in that it uses a probabilistic approach rather than a linear transformation. t-sne constructs a probability distribution for each point, estimating the proximity to others with gaussian normal distribution at high dimensions and t-distribution at low dimensions in an attempt to preserve similarities of nearby points. t-sne is particularly useful in projecting raw high-dimensional data into labeled clusters for better visual and comprehendible purposes.",want minimize number features counteract curse dimensionality variance inflation factor vif assists identifying multicollinearity independent variables needs run prior principal component analysis pca pca eliminate redundancy projects feature space rsquare quantifies amount variance explained model reveal multicollinearity compromise number features rsquareâ€”increasing number features increase rsquare cost instability pca application singular value decomposition svd dimensionality reduction technique creates principal components pcs orthogonal ordered variance explained first pc explains variance followed rest pcs conversion enables dimensionality reduction multidimensional set fewer dimensions eg reducing 2d problem 1d pca however diminishes interpretability whatif analysis possible pcs mathematical abstractions actual featuresit mostly dimensionality reduction predictive modeling visualization exploratory analysis eda decide ordinary regression pca regression pca good reducing highdimensional expense interpretability complicates linking predictions original variables another dimensionality reduction method tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tsne differs pca uses probabilistic approach rather linear transformation tsne constructs probability distribution point estimating proximity others gaussian normal distribution high dimensions tdistribution low dimensions attempt preserve similarities nearby points tsne particularly useful projecting raw highdimensional labeled clusters visual comprehendible purposes,170,12,16.754677,15.907725,12,0.8635974,9
557," in today's class, we continued the discussion of vif, in which we saw that if a feature's vif value is high, then that feature is highly dependent on other features. vif is used for determining multicollinearity. in vif analysis, we set up a threshold, any feature having vif above it can be removed. then we move onto principal component analysis(pca), in which we plot vif against r^2. we see that the principal components are orthogonal to each other. as the number of principal components increases, the number of dimensions in the data also increases. pc are the axis which captures the best variance in the data. the function y=f(x) can be interpreted as y=f(pc) and it has mainly two uses, for prediction and answering what-if type questions. pc analysis can be used for data reduction, dimension reduction, in prediction models, and visualization in eda to understand the structure of data. pca is sensitive to data scale and hence we need to normalize the data. we saw two examples of this in the class, in which the blood parameter data was one. at last, we see about t-sne, which is t-distribution schematic neighbour encoding, which is a lossy transformation and helps mapping of multi-dimensional data to one-dimensional or two-dimensional data.",class continued vif saw features vif value high feature highly dependent features vif determining multicollinearity vif analysis set threshold feature vif removed move onto principal component analysispca plot vif r2 see principal components orthogonal number principal components increases number dimensions also increases pc axis captures best variance function yfx interpreted yfpc mainly two uses prediction answering whatif type questions pc analysis reduction dimension reduction prediction models visualization eda understand structure pca sensitive scale hence need normalize saw two examples class blood parameter one last see tsne tdistribution schematic neighbour encoding lossy transformation helps mapping multidimensional onedimensional twodimensional,97,12,18.59734,16.16572,12,0.861693,10
562,"we started the lecture where we left off last time, discussing about the vif values and the iterative procedure of finding the most independent features. we understood that the threshold value chosen should have some justification. we then moved on to pca i.e. principal component analysis. we discussed that pca helps us to reduce the dimensionality of our problem, by somewhat changing the axes of our data such that each axis helps to describe the maximum variance in the data. thus pc1 axes captures maximum variance, pc2 captures the next maximum variance and so on. a simple example could be a two dimensional linear data, which could be reduced to one dimension by taking the axis along the line. we need to check how many principal components we need in order to explain majority of the variance of the data. each principal component is a linear combination of each of the original features. the coefficient of each feature in the linear combination, is known as loadings. now in between pca and vif, the vif procedure should be done first as it eliminates multicolinearity which is a bigger issue. also, pca hinders with our interpretability as the features are not what they actually meant, but a combination of multiple features. however, pca does help us in dimension reduction, for making good predictions and also in visualisation and understanding the structure of the data. when used for visualisation, pca becomes a part of eda. pca requires normalisation of the data. if pc1 and pc2 cover 70 to 80 percent of the variance of the data, then the multidimensional data can be visualised in two dimensions by plotting the data on a pc1 vs pc2 plot. now for better visualisation, we have another tool called tsne. tsne is a lossy transformation which helps us to visualise our data in two dimensions. it is based on the t-distribution and also uses gradient descent, and is hence slow and not consistent. tsne calculates a probability distribution of all the other points being close to one certain point. it does this for each and every point. this data is taken into a matrix and then the dimension is reduced. tsne means t-distributed stochastic neighbour encoding. t-distribution helps us to magnify the difference between the points if there exists any, and thus helps in classification and clustering.

279,"we started with vif, variance inflation factor( effect of all the axes {except xi} on xi). if greater vif-> r^2 is close to 1.{heavy dependence of xi on rest of them} no problem if we eliminate that feature. progressively, keep on eliminating features one by one {on the basis of higher vif for feature reduction}.

pca-> the max number of pc's are equal to the number of dimensions of the dataset. whenever we do pca, always pc1 is something which explains the maximum variation in the data. pc2 explans the 2nd max amount of variation in the data. pc helps you reduce the dimensionality of the problem. each pc can be linearly dependent on all of the real dimensions.

so what should we do first pca or vif?
vif, because it reduces the real dimension which could have been incorporated in the pca without eliminating them. later after real dimension elimination we get the real picture and the pca would be so beneficial to us for dimension reduction.

662,"today's session discussed variance inflation factor (vif) and principal component analysis (pca) in-depth.

we first discussed vif, a statistical factor to check for multicollinearity among independent variables in regression models. we understood that high vif suggests high correlation between independent variables, which tends to bias the coefficient estimates and decrease model interpretability. the session discussed vif, its interpretation, and how to deal with multicollinearity. the method consists of removing features individually, beginning from the largest vif, so that all remaining features have a vif value less than an arbitrarily selected value. this both reduces the curse of dimensionality and enhances the performance of the model. we also saw that vif scores would tend to form an elbow-like pattern upon plotting, from which a threshold can be conveniently determined.

then, we discussed pca, which is an unsupervised method of reducing dimension with retaining the maximum variance in the data. pca is dependent on singular value decomposition (svd) and assists in transforming data to a new set of uncorrelated principal components. principal components are orthogonal to one another, thus ensuring that multicollinearity is removed. we also observed how pca has the capability of dimension reduction from higher dimensions to lower dimensions, as in the example where data was reduced from two dimensions to one.

a major difference between vif and pca was explored. vif is usually performed first to provide better interpretability because it maintains the original features, which would make prediction simpler to interpret. pca, however, converts features into principal components, so it is better used for ""what-if"" analysis or delta analysis than for explicit prediction.

the session also touched on various applications of pca, such as dimensionality reduction, predictive modeling, and visualization (particularly in exploratory data analysis - eda). but we observed that pca is scale-dependent, and thus normalization becomes an essential preprocessing step.

near the conclusion, t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) was introduced as yet another dimension reduction method. it was briefly mentioned how a gaussian and t-distribution comparison on the same dataset highlighted differences between them in picking up data variance.

the session, in summary, illustrated how vif and pca assist with multicollinearity and dimension reduction, ensuring machine learning models are interpretable and effective.",variance inflation factor vif principal component analysis pca indepth first vif statistical factor check multicollinearity among independent variables regression models understood high vif suggests high correlation independent variables tends bias coefficient estimates decrease model interpretability vif interpretation deal multicollinearity method consists removing features individually beginning largest vif remaining features vif value less arbitrarily selected value reduces curse dimensionality enhances performance model also saw vif scores would tend form elbowlike pattern upon plotting threshold conveniently determined pca unsupervised method reducing dimension retaining maximum variance pca dependent singular value decomposition svd assists transforming new set uncorrelated principal components principal components orthogonal one another thus ensuring multicollinearity removed also observed pca capability dimension reduction higher dimensions lower dimensions reduced two dimensions one major difference vif pca explored vif usually performed first provide interpretability maintains original features would make prediction simpler interpret pca however converts features principal components whatif analysis delta analysis explicit prediction also touched applications pca dimensionality reduction predictive modeling visualization particularly exploratory analysis eda observed pca scaledependent thus normalization becomes essential preprocessing step near conclusion tsne tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding introduced yet another dimension reduction method briefly mentioned gaussian tdistribution comparison dataset highlighted differences picking variance illustrated vif pca assist multicollinearity dimension reduction ensuring machine learning models interpretable effective,208,12,15.886087,17.653791,12,0.8489727,13

375,in today's class we mainly discussed vif and pca. vif stands for variance inflation factor which is used to see if there is any relation between the features or not. higher value of vif suggests a high co-relation. then we also discussed a plot between r squared and vif where we saw elbows at 5 and 10. then we discussed pca  which stands for principle component analysis where we choose an axis where the variance is maximum of the features. then the other axis has some less variance and this goes on. single value decomposition is used while performing principle component analysis.,class mainly vif pca vif stands variance inflation factor see relation features higher value vif suggests high corelation also plot r squared vif saw elbows 5 10 pca stands principle component analysis choose axis variance maximum features axis less variance goes single value decomposition performing principle component analysis,48,12,18.271402,16.912891,12,0.8387059,15
399,"in today's class we learnt some more things about variance inflation factor or vif. we latch on to the highest value and remove it and recalculate the vif. if we change vif threshold to like 5 then it will just be all those features with r square corresponding to five or less. if there is some important feature then we have to keep it irrespective of its vif. at last we can create classification model with left out variables.
then we learnt about pca or principal component analysis.principal components are necessarily perpendicular to each other. if we have 10pcs then we can decide like upto 2 or 3 are important .
eg - pc1 captures the best variance , pc2 : second best and so on....
now instead of y=f(x), we will have y= f(pc) ,  this is pc regression instead of normal regression , we can use pc for prediction but not for what if or explain the results.
purposes of pca analysis are dimension reduction, data reduction, prediction models and visualisation or understanding the structure of data using eda

611,"vif vs r-square
features vs r-square trade-off 
our goal is to reduce the number of features because of the curse of dimensionality. 
pca: an application of svd (singular value decomposition). if we have a data set like x1 vs x2. we can have as many pcs as the dimensions, pc1 and pc2, ensuring they are orthogonal. the orientation of these pc axes is such that the 1st one accounts for the maximum variability and then less as we follow. orginally, this problem is a 2-dimensional problem which has been reduced to 1 dimension through pca!
pca helps us to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. vif (needs to be done first) vs pca 
interpretability: pcs help with prediction but their interpretability is very low. we can't perform what if analysis with pcs as they are not even real features, they are just mathematical features used for predictability. we can't link predictions with original variables if we use pca.
pca analysis is used for (1) dimension reduction (2) prediction model (3) visualization (understanding the structure of data) 
pca is a part of eda. then we select if we have to go for normal regression vs pca regression.
disadvantages of pca
advantage: if we have very big data, we can visualize it using pca. original data had many dimensions (columns) which can be significantly compressed using relevant pcs
another important dimensionality reduction method is tsne; t distribution vs gaussian normal distribution; tsne is a probabilistic method.

the number of principal components equals the original data dimensions, but we select the most important ones.
principal components are orthogonal to each other.

99,"we learned that if we have a large number of features, then the correlation matrix is a good way to understand the pairwise relation between the parameters. 
then we compared the variance inflation factor(vif) of all the parameters.
then we aimed to reduce the parameters to reduce the complexity and computation power. we can do it by calculating the vif and removing parameters that have very high vif values. this helps reduce the complexity by minimal change in the model's accuracy.
then we studied principal component analysis. the no of principal components is equal to the dimensions of the dataset. all the principal components are orthogonal to each other.
then we understood the elbow diagram and came to know how many principal components are actually required to have a 95% confidence interval. we then accordingly removed features to simplify the dataset.

256,"in todayâ€™s lecture we saw some more methods to reduce the dimensionality of data, inorder to solve data problems associated with large dimensions. 
in the last class, we had talked about vif analysis. we continued the discussion on it. 
in vif analysis, we start eliminating the features one by one, with the ones having large vif values. we continue the process until we get a set of features which have vif values, smaller than the desired threshold, which can be 10/5. we eliminate the features based on our domain knowledge.
depending on the threshold set, we can have different combination and numbers of features selected for the regression model. in such a case, we should evaluate the metrics for each of the model and then by comparing these, we can decide which one to use.
the next method we saw was that of pca (principal component analysis). it helps to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by creating orthogonal principal components. each of the principal component is a combination of the original features, with the weights called as â€˜loadingsâ€™. the loadings tell us the importance of each feature. so, instead of using too many features, we are combining them into a principal component and using this to predict the response variable. the number of principal components is equal to that of the original dimensions. however, we can decide to take up two/three of these pcs suitable to our model. the first pc explains the maximum variance in the data, the next explains some amount of the remaining variance. this continues until all the principal components explain the complete variance in the data.
the cumulative variance explained by all the pcs is given by the elbow diagram, which is asymptotic to 1. the elbow diagram tells us how many pcs would be needed to explain a certain amount of variance in the data.
among the two methods, vif is generally preferred first because of interpretability. x1,x2,x3 etc.  represent the actual physical features, whereas the pcs, which are a combination of these are just mathematical parameters. 
so, pcs are most suitable for prediction analysis but they cannot be used for â€˜what-if analysisâ€™ or â€˜delta analysisâ€™. hence, through pcs we achieve the goal of reducing the dimensions, however we cannot do any sensitivity analysis.
so, normally vif is done first and if still there are many features left, we perform pca.
the advantages of using pca is that it helps in dimension reduction (data reduction), predictive analysis, visualization (understanding of the structure of the data). so, this is a part of eda and can be used to determine the number of clusters (k) in k-means clustering.
another disadvantage of pca is that it is sensitive to data scale. hence, normalization (if required) must be done before doing pca.
next, we talked about the t-sne plots. 
the t-sne plots also reduce the large number of dimensions in the data into 2-3 dimensions which can be easily visualized. this is done on the basis of the distance between the points in the n-dimensional space. through this method, we lose the exactness of the data, but instead we get the information about the relative closeness of the points. 
t-sne creates a probability distribution for each of the point, which contains the probability of closeness of that point from every other point. 
gaussian normal distribution is used in higher dimensional space, but in t-sne, as the name suggests, t-distribution is used. t-distribution increases the distance between dissimilar points. so, in n-dimensional space, if the probability of two points being close is very high, they are clustered together in the t-sne plots.
all these methods help in reducing the number of dimensions in the data set.

158,"in today's class, sir explained vif(variance inflation factor) and pca(principal component analysis). from the plot of vif vs râ², we came to know that râ² values also came down if we mechanically tend to reduce the number of features excessively to reduce the vif, but this can lead to bad prediction model. thus there is always an trade-off between lowering of vif value and minimum râ² value you need for your model. higher vif or higher p-values suggest that the parameter/features' dependence is larger on other parameters, thus we can drop those high depending parameters. then we learned more about pcs (principal components); 1. pcs are perpendicular to each other, 2. number of pcs = number of dimensions in original dataset, 3. pc1 represents the highest variance, pc2 represents second highest variance and so on.. 
we will take number of pcs such that their cumulative variance fraction is >=0.95. then we discussed loadings of pcs and that the latter is the linear combination of variances. then we discussed interpretibility, real features (vif), non-real features (pca), and pros and cons of pca wrt to vif. 
at last, sir discussed t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbour encoding) which maps n-dimension distance probability (found using gaussian distribution) into 2-d or at max 3-d (now the probability if calculated using t-distribution). why t-distribution? because it can give probability of distant points in distribution as compared to gaussian distribution where probability of distant point in distribution is nearly zero. also t-distribution is helpful in another way as it further increases the distance between points when on mapped on 2-d space as compared to the distance on n-dimension.",class sir explained vifvariance inflation factor pcaprincipal component analysis plot vif vs râ² came know râ² values also came mechanically tend reduce number features excessively reduce vif lead bad prediction model thus always tradeoff lowering vif value minimum râ² value need model higher vif higher pvalues suggest parameterfeatures dependence larger parameters thus drop high depending parameters learned pcs principal components 1 pcs perpendicular 2 number pcs number dimensions original dataset 3 pc1 represents highest variance pc2 represents second highest variance take number pcs cumulative variance fraction 095 loadings pcs latter linear combination variances interpretibility real features vif nonreal features pca pros cons pca wrt vif last sir tsne tdistributed stochastic neighbour encoding maps ndimension distance probability found using gaussian distribution 2d max 3d probability calculated using tdistribution tdistribution give probability distant points distribution compared gaussian distribution probability distant point distribution nearly zero also tdistribution helpful another way increases distance points mapped 2d space compared distance ndimension,156,12,16.591963,14.380146,12,0.7942653,27
421,"today we discussed a bit about vif and how a threshold should be selected with a reason. and we moved to pca, a technique that helps us reduce dimensionality. so in pca the pc axes are all orthogonal to each other, and they are linear combination of the initial features. pc1 has the highest variance, followed by pc2 and so on.
between vif and pca, vif ids thee one that should be done first as it gives an idea of the multicollinearity of the features that is more pressing to know and then pca can be used for visualization of the data.
there was another technique discussed for visualization, which was tsne, which gives a depiction in 2 dimensions. but this transformation is a lossy one. its comparatively slower as it is a stochastic process involving the t distribution.",bit vif threshold selected reason moved pca technique helps us reduce dimensionality pca pc axes orthogonal linear combination initial features pc1 highest variance followed pc2 vif pca vif ids thee one done first gives idea multicollinearity features pressing know pca visualization another technique visualization tsne gives depiction 2 dimensions transformation lossy one comparatively slower stochastic process involving distribution,58,12,19.287289,14.1725445,12,0.7684298,28
592,"we continued with the correlation problems. we observed the heat maps for perfectly co-related data and partially correlated data. heatmaps are more coherent if they are created after sorting the data. when we calculate vif, we do not process the values of y but only x-values. vif is simply the function of x. f(x(i != j)). in this method, we progressively eliminate the features based on threshold vif. we have to decide on the threshold value of r^2 because we only choose the vif values below the threshold. we have to check if the feature being eliminated is important for the data or not. if it is important, we can't just eliminate it. 
lesson: don't do think mechanically. 
principal component analysis: principal components are necessarily orthogonal to each other. number of principal components is equal number of dimensions of the data. out of these principal components, we have to decide which among these are important. pc1 is the axis that captures the best variance in the data, pc2 is the second best axis to capture variance. pca actually helps us to reduce the dimensionality of the data. we plot the fraction of variance for these components. these plots are called elbow plot. each principal component is a mixture of features multiplied by loading. but do not blindly follow the process. first check if the dimensionality should need to be reduced or not. in general vif needs to be done first, because inter-collinearity is a big problem. 
after pca, instead of representing y as a function of x, we represent it in the form of function of pca. after representing we do what-if analysis on the function. we later explain the results however with pca we lose explainability. we can't do any sensitive analyses. vif reduced the number of features in real space. and if we still have many methods, we can go for pca. 
pca helps in dimension reduction, helps predicting model, helps in visualization of data. when pca is used for visualization, which comes under eda. pca pre-supposes normalization in the data. we need to normalize the data before using pca. we then tried these method on the data from midsem and noticed that out of 24, 18 features were needed to explain the data. pca is a lossless method, data is not lost. 
we started with t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbor encoding). t stands for t-distribution. probability wise, t-distribution predicts more probability for wide spread data; gaussian on the other hand is tighter. it is stochastic in nature and gradient descent is involved in the process, hence while running itâ€™s code, it is likely to take time. here we lose the exactness of data but gain the closeness of data. we can map multi-dimensional data onto lower dimensional data. we usually do not prefer to plot beyond 3 dimensions.

474,"in this class, sir told that he will discuss about data problems. if the correlation between data is not proper, we use variance inflation factor. vif=1-/(1-r^2). vif= 10 occurs for r^2 around 0.8. we progressively keep eliminating the variables with higher values of vif.  if we go on removing variables with high vif values, we will have some variables with low vif values which have high r^2 square values. we need to remove some variables to eliminate the curse of dimensionality. another method to handle data problems is principal component analysis. principle components are orthogonal to each other. we can find principal components equal to the dimension of data. we transform axis so that transformed axes capture variance of data best. we plot graph of two variables x1 and x2 say. if the points are spread around a straight line passing through origin, this straight line will be a principle component. this line will capture most of the variance. if we create plot % variance explained by each principle component, this is known as elbow curve. based on this curve we eliminate variables. but the problem with this is pc1=c11.x1+c12.x2+.....-linear combination of all variables, where c11,c12,c13,... are called loadings. we have to perform vif first and then use pca. interpretability- after doing pca, y=f(pc) using this we can do prediction or do 'what if analysis'. but it is difficult to explain the results of prediction or what if analysis with pca. because pca are a mathematical representation of variables. we will lose explain ability if we perform pca. vif reduces the features, so we do vif first and see if many features are getting eliminated. then we can do pca if required. pc analysis- dimension reduction, prediction models and visualization. lets consider image data- dimensionality of this data is number of pixels. before pca we might need to normalise the data. mnist data set is a collection of hand written numbers. these have been converted into 28x28 pixels. we want to train a classifier which can recognise numbers. we perform pca on this data and realise that there are 784 variables but only 70-80 are useful. this also results in data reduction. then we can do 2d and 3d plots to visualise this data. pca is mathematically exact. if our idea is to visualise the data effectively we need to tsne. t distribution- derived from gaussian distribution and it is more spread out as compared to gaussian distribution. tsne is a lossy transform, we loose exactness of data and gain relative closeness of data. tsne is lossy transformation, so use it carefully. the process of tsne itself give the structure of data. t-sne is a machine learning algorithm that is used for dimensionality reduction and data visualisation. it works by finding the similarity measures between pairs of instances in higher and lower dimensional spaces and tries to maintain the probability distribution for data samples in lower dimensions same as the probability distribution of data samples in higher dimensions. t-sne- t-distributed stochastic neighbour encoding.

535,"heatmaps are useful visualization tools for pairwise analysis when plotting all parameters individually is impractical, although they lack detailed numeric insights. variance inflation factor (vif) helps detect multicollinearity by measuring how much a feature's variance increases due to correlations with other features; features with high vif values above a certain threshold should be removed first to reduce multicollinearity. principal component analysis (pca), derived from singular value decomposition (svd), transforms correlated variables into orthogonal principal components (pcs), each being a weighted sum of original parameters (weights known as loadings). pca reduces dimensionality, aids prediction models, data compression, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (eda), but cannot perform sensitivity or ""what-if"" analysis since pcs aren't directly interpretable as original parameters. pca is sensitive to data scaling, thus normalization is necessary. in contrast, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne) employs a stochastic gradient descent approach based on t-distribution for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and visualization, preserving local relationships but losing exact numeric information (lossy transformation).",heatmaps useful visualization tools pairwise analysis plotting parameters individually impractical although lack detailed numeric insights variance inflation factor vif helps detect multicollinearity measuring much features variance increases due correlations features features high vif values certain threshold removed first reduce multicollinearity principal component analysis pca derived singular value decomposition svd transforms correlated variables orthogonal principal components pcs weighted sum original parameters weights known loadings pca reduces dimensionality aids prediction models compression visualization exploratory analysis eda cannot perform sensitivity whatif analysis since pcs arent directly interpretable original parameters pca sensitive scaling thus normalization necessary contrast tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tsne employs stochastic gradient descent approach based tdistribution nonlinear dimensionality reduction visualization preserving local relationships losing exact numeric information lossy transformation,118,12,15.297886,15.991108,12,0.7347139,32
484,"vif (variance inflation factor)
purpose: vif is used to detect multicollinearity in regression models.
process: we progressively removed values of ei (likely referring to certain features or variables).
outcome: the test was conducted in code 2, and it helped in removing extra features.

bca (principal component analysis)
principal components (pc):
  principal components are orthogonal, meaning they are uncorrelated.
  the maximum number of components is equal to the number of dimensions in the original dataset.

variance explained by components:
  the first principal component (pc1) explains most of the variance in the data.
  the second principal component (pc2) explains the next largest portion of the variance, and so on.

loadings:
  if pc1 is a linear combination of original features, say c1x1 + c2x2 + c3x3, the parameters c1, c2, c3 are called loadings.
  the loading values indicate the strength of influence that each variable has on the component. for example, if c3 is large for pc1, then x3 (the original variable) greatly influences the variance explained by pc1.

multicollinearity:
  vif is typically calculated first to detect and address multicollinearity, which can be an issue in regression models.

loss of interpretability with pca:
  one downside of pca is that it loses interpretability. for instance, if x1 is a known parameter, we cannot easily quantify how changes in x1 will affect the result after applying pca.

uses of pca:
  dimension reduction: pca helps reduce the number of variables, making the data easier to handle.
  prediction models: pca can be used to create more efficient predictive models.
  visualization: pca is often used for visualizing high-dimensional data by reducing it to two or three dimensions.

choosing between models:
  there is a choice between using y = fx (where f is a matrix of features) or using y = pcs (principal components).
  it is generally better to normalize the data before performing pca to ensure that all features are treated equally in terms of their influence on the components.

mnist dataset and normalization
normalization importance:
  pca on the mnist dataset highlighted the importance of normalizing the data. normalization ensures that all features contribute equally to the principal components.

t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding)
overview: t-sne is a lossy transformation technique that is commonly used for dimensionality reduction and visualization, particularly for high-dimensional data.

methodology:
  t-sne uses gradient descent and stochastic methods.
  step 1: create a probability distribution for each observation in the dataset.
  more accurately, we calculate a distribution that represents the distance between each point and every other point in the dataset.
  hence, there are n x n distributions, where n is the number of data points.

why t-distribution:
  a t-distribution is used because it is flatter compared to a normal distribution, making it more sensitive to long-distance points. this helps in maintaining the relationships between distant points.

goal: the goal of t-sne is to minimize the kullback-leibler (kl) divergence, which measures the difference between the original high-dimensional probability distribution and the low-dimensional projection.

by reviewing the bar plot of the target variable, we observed that the target for ""heart diseases"" is under-sampled. in this case, if obtaining more data is not possible, we must acknowledge that accurately predicting the target is not feasible. the professor also demonstrated how to extract insights from histograms and heat maps of the features, and how to decide whether we need to drop certain columns, apply feature scaling, or use dimensionality reduction.

he then explained when to use techniques like pca (principal component analysis) or t-sne. the selection of the appropriate method, such as a tree-based model, svm, or logistic regression, depends on the type of data and the problem we are aiming to solve.

curse of dimensionality arises in high-dimensional spaces, causing sparsity, overfitting, and computational inefficiency. vif detects multicollinearity; high vif (>10) indicates predictors are near-linear combinations, causing unstable estimates. while vif addresses redundancy, the curse focuses on feature volume. mitigate vif by removing features or regularization; combat the curse via dimensionality reduction (e.g., pca) or feature selection. both ensure robust models.

we also explored forward and backward feature selection and the risk of overfitting. when dealing with nonlinear models that combine trigonometry and linear elements, we considered whether a single model could handle both instead of relying on separate approaches. random forest turned out to be a method that naturally does this by combining different models.

along the way, we compared parametric and non-parametric methods, introduced delta analysis, and briefly touched on neural networks and deep learning, particularly models with multiple hidden layers. finally, we wrapped up with classification, covering regression vs. logistic regression, the concept of weights, and the sigmoid function, including its graphs and explanations.

then we moved on to the topic of polynomial regression where understood the inclusion of higher order variable creating a complex polynomial equation and performing regression analysis on the same. we then started our discussion on feature selection where we understood about forward(adding most relevant independent variables) and backward(eliminate variables with low significance) selection and their significance. 
we further dived into understanding the parametric and non parametric models which involves distinction on limiting on number of parameters to optimise the loss function. parametric methods are simples with limited parameters but hallucinate or find it difficult to cope up with complexities and tend to underfit. non parametric models like knn, random forest use the complete data capturing more intricate relationships with the rosk of overfitting. thus we need to analyse our data clearly to get the best optimisation possible.

277,"to improve our results, we focused on three key areas: refining the data, enhancing our methods, and fine-tuning those methods. hereâ€™s how we approached it:

we started with multiple linear regression (mlr) for simple, linear relationships. however, when dealing with more complex, nonlinear data, we introduced features like \(x^2\) and \(\sin(x)\) to capture the patterns. this approach evolved into polynomial regression. initially, adding more features improved the model, but over time, it started to perform poorly. to address this, we kept only the most significant features based on their p-values.

we also experimented with feature selection techniques, such as forward and backward selection. the main challenge was avoiding overfittingâ€”where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data. instead of using separate models for different types of relationships, we considered combining them into a single model. random forest emerged as a strong candidate for this approach.

next, we explored both parametric and non-parametric methods, along with delta analysis. we also briefly introduced neural networks and deep learning, which use multiple layers to uncover complex patterns in data. finally, we shifted our focus to classification, comparing traditional regression with logistic regression. we discussed the role of weights and introduced the sigmoid function, which is central to logistic regression due to its s-shaped curve.",improve results focused three key areas refining enhancing methods finetuning methods hereâ€™s approached started multiple linear regression mlr simple linear relationships however dealing complex nonlinear introduced features like x2 sinx capture patterns approach evolved polynomial regression initially adding features improved model time started perform poorly address kept significant features based pvalues also experimented feature selection techniques forward backward selection main challenge avoiding overfittingâ€”where model performs well training poorly new instead using separate models different types relationships considered combining single model random forest emerged strong candidate approach next explored parametric nonparametric methods along delta analysis also briefly introduced neural networks deep learning use multiple layers uncover complex patterns finally shifted focus classification comparing traditional regression logistic regression role weights introduced sigmoid function central logistic regression due sshaped curve,127,13,0.93692356,-12.347611,13,0.788067,6

294,"to improve the results you can either improve the sample or improve the method used. improving the sample could mean increasing the quality of the sample or the quantity. when it comes to improving the method, you can either fine-tune or better understand the method or use multiple and select the best one based on your knowledge about the metrics. one technique used to improve the method is call grid search where you form an n-dimensional grid with all the possible value combinations of the n parameters of the method, and then evaluate which one is the best.
polynomial regression is a type of linear regression where we add additional features derived from the given features, and they are respectively, the features raised to an exponent, eg.- x1 -> x1^2, x1^3, etc. more generally, we can use domain knowledge and insights gained from exploratory data analysis to engineer even better features.
there are two extremes to the process of feature selection. in forward feature selection, we start with an empty set of selected features, and then based on our knowledge, keep on adding features to the dataset in the hopes of improving the results. in backward feature selection, we start with all the features we can think of and then start reducing them by some metric (eg. p-value).
in parametric methods (such as linear regression), we can perform delta analysis, which is answering questions like how much does the output change with a slight change in a particular feature. this can be somehow achieved in non-parametric models also, but is much easier in parametric ones.
in real life after spending 80% of the time doing something with the data that does not include 'fitting a model', we actually need to fit many models and then decide which amongst them is the best based on various factors, some of which are: interpretability (whether we can make sense of what the model is doing), maintainability (the model will have to be recreated when 'data drift' {some change(s) to the trend in the data that occurs with time} is observed, hence if one model can fit the whole data, it is better), and of course the understanding and feel for numbers and error metrics.
a neural network is a model where we have hidden layers that are connected to input and output and amongst themselves using links that have an associated weights. the output function can still be expressed as w_i*x_i. more layers (called deep neural networks) add more flexibility / provide more degrees of freedom to the neural network, but in turn it becomes extremely 'data hungry'. the latest neural network models such as chatgpt have billions of parameters and are trained on internet-scale data, but the task that it performs is just: given a few characters / words, what is the most likely next character / word.
logistic regression is classification period.
need to predict the boundaries that separate the different classes. in case of overlap, we look for minimizing the number of mis-classifications. define an equation for the boundary and then based on the output, assign a class label. one such function that can do this is the sigmoid function (s(a) = 1/(1+e^(-a))).",improve results either improve sample improve method improving sample could mean increasing quality sample quantity comes improving method either finetune understand method use multiple select best one based knowledge metrics one technique improve method call grid search form ndimensional grid possible value combinations n parameters method evaluate one best polynomial regression type linear regression add additional features derived given features respectively features raised exponent eg x1 x12 x13 etc generally use domain knowledge insights gained exploratory analysis engineer even features two extremes process feature selection forward feature selection start empty set selected features based knowledge keep adding features dataset hopes improving results backward feature selection start features think start reducing metric eg pvalue parametric methods linear regression perform delta analysis answering questions like much output change slight change particular feature somehow achieved nonparametric models also much easier parametric ones real life spending 80 time something include fitting model actually need fit many models decide amongst best based factors interpretability whether make sense model maintainability model recreated drift changes trend occurs time observed hence one model fit whole course understanding feel numbers error metrics neural network model hidden layers connected input output amongst using links associated weights output function still expressed wixi layers called deep neural networks add flexibility provide degrees freedom neural network turn becomes extremely hungry latest neural network models chatgpt billions parameters trained internetscale task performs given characters words likely next character word logistic regression classification period need predict boundaries separate different classes case overlap look minimizing number misclassifications define equation boundary based output assign class label one function sigmoid function sa 11ea,265,13,-0.5515254,-9.3617115,13,0.7731775,9

380,"in today's lecture first we started by answering the question how to improve the quality of results? there are three ways to do so:
1-  to increase the quality  and size of sample|
2- improve the method like by using multiple methods and selecting the best one
3- fine tuning or properly using the methods
then we learnt that in linear regression outcome is expressed as linear combination of independent variables and there is nothing else linear in that.
when we have four features which are like x , x^2,x^3,x^4 and sin x , then
eventually your model will try to minimise coefficients of all the x1 to x4 and the coefficient of sin x will resemble the most that is will be the maximum so many of the features have to be eliminated otherwise the model will become unfavourable.
then we learn the basic difference between forward feature engineering and backward feature engineering. forward feature engineering is that we start with one feature and then keep adding until the performance becomes better and backward feature engineering is just the reverse of it that is we start with all the features and eliminate 1 by 1 based on the performance.
so naturally what we do is that we get the data we perform exploratory data analysis then we preprocesses and then we see multiple methods and then we compare them using the matrix and then select the best one.
after that we learnt about parametric like neural networks like which has the weights involved and if there is more than one layer in a neural network it is called as deep learning network.
in artificial neural network the data should be large otherwise overfitting will happen.
if we have to compare just the model within itself then we compare mean squared error with the value of y bar to get percentage and check whether the model is good within itself or not.
can we started with classification which is supervised learning in which why denotes the class and we have x and y both are available it is used for distinguishing between the discrete values.

201,"in summary, forward feature engineering and backward feature engineering are two
techniques used in machine learning for selecting relevant features to include in a model.
forward feature engineering starts with an empty feature set and iteratively adds one
feature at a time based on their performance, while backward feature engineering starts
with a complete set of features and removes features one by one until the model
performance reaches a peak. both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages
and can be used in combination to optimize the feature selection process. the resulting regression method is known

530,"we began by addressing a doubt from the previous lecture summaries. it was about the ways in which we can improve our results from the model apart from just increasing the sample size. so, we can also consider and try out different models before fixing one. we can compare the various metrics of these models and figure out the best one. if we want to stick at our original model, we can fine tune/ use it more appropriately to improve the quality of our results. one of the solutions suggested was that of grid search.
after having a brief discussion about the statistics from the summary submissions of the previous classes, we then moved on to understand the significance of feature engineering in improving our results from the model. by using feature engineering, we can create more features or destroy the already existing ones, to arrive at a set of most relevant and appropriate features that significantly describe the data. we can use something like polynomial regression. we already have one feature, x1 with us. we can raise it to higher and higher powers and introduce these as additional features in the mlr model. we can also have a combination of the polynomial and trigonometric functions like sin(x1). we observe that as we start adding more and more of these features to our model through feature engineering, the r2 value increases, however the adjusted r2 decreases. this is because we are adding more and more features to the model which do not significantly improve the results. hence, by using feature engineering and analyzing the scatter plots and histograms of errors, we can arrive at the best set of features for our model, which can explain much of the variation in the data.
all this is a part of exploratory data analysis (eda).
there are two types of feature engineering techniques - forward feature engineering and backward feature engineering. in forward feature engineering, we keep on adding more and more features in our model, by transforming the existing features. in backward feature engineering, we start eliminating these features one by one from the model, already having many features to arrive at the best set of features. the elimination is done on the basis of the p-values of the corresponding coefficients.
after this, we talked about multiple model creation. so, in real life scenarios we first have to get the data, then perform eda and preprocess it to get â€˜good dataâ€™. this good data can now be fed to multiple models. we can simultaneously compare the metrics of all the models and decide the best one from that. we can use multiple or single models to fit our data, depending on the variations in it. however, if a single model describes the data well, then it is always preferred over handling multiple models.
so, mainly there are two types of models- parametric and non-parametric. in parametric models, we can control the various parameters (regression coefficients) and we can also perform â€˜delta analysisâ€™ on it. this means we can find out how much the y value would change if the x value changes by an amount, say delta. slr and mlr are examples of such a model. however, in non-parametric models, like random forest, we cannot perform delta analysis, instead they give us better predictions than the parametric models. these models are also more flexible, i.e. they can adapt to different types of data well.
one of the models which we used on the data was the artificial neural networks (ann). ann consists of â€˜hidden layer(s)â€™ which have nodes. these nodes map/ link to each and every other node in the network to form â€˜linksâ€™. these links have certain weights associated with them. the y value is a function of these weights and the x values. these weights keep changing and are recalculated as more and more features are introduced. when there are more than 1 hidden layer in the network, we call it the â€˜deep learningâ€™ network.
more the layers, more capable the model becomes but at the same time we need to feed more data in the network. data (x values) is converted into information, which is represented by the weights.
we fitted many models on the same data set, and compared various metrics like r2, mse, etc. of these to determine the best model for the data. apart from comparing between models, we can also use the metrics, like mse within the model, to assess its validity.
we compared the relative difference between the metrics of the test and train data for a single model, to arrive at meaningful conclusions.
lastly, we started with classification models and discussed logistic regression in that. these classification models are used on discrete data like nominal and ordinal data to classify it into various classes. the y values are called â€˜labelsâ€™ and they determine a particular class. using logistic regression, we are trying to find out the line/ curve which separates or segregates the data into different clusters, such that misclassification despite of overlapping is minimized.

we concluded by discussing the sigmoid function and how it can be used to identify the equation of the line. further discussions to be continued in the next class.

417,"multiple linear regression: 
linear regression = outcome is expressed as linear combination of independent variables. 
taylor series ==> apply to mlr to capture the nonlinearity in the datset
this is just polynomial regression. the original was nonlinear so we engineer more features and then try to fit the model, the feature that fits best (like the sinusoid the in class example) will have more weight. so p value decreases and adjacent r2 value will decreases if you keep adding lot of feature more than required. 

forward feature engineering: put all possibl features and eliminate them one by one
backward feature engineering: start minimal set of feature and keep adding 1 by 1 based on your domain knowledge

usual methodology:
get data ==> preprocess & eda ==> good data ==> multiple ml methods ==> compare metrics ==> select best (or a combination of multiple methods with a weighted mean)

for a given data (the one in class): is it better to fit 1 model and 2? i think 1 because it would take into account for the variation in unknown data to be tested or applied later on. but 2 models might overfit.
then we got an overview of non parameter models like knn and random forest.

todayâ€™s class discussion start on a topic of how to improve the quality of results ? we can do this by 1) improving the sample like quality and size of sample 2) improving the method like using multiple methods and selecting the best one 3) fine tuning of methods or properly using the methods example â€” gridsearch
the new definition of linear regression is that outcome is expressed as a linear combination of independent variables.
when using mlr for any datasets and if the error plot is not random follows a pattern. this indicates that forcing a line to model this data results in incorrect results. we need to introduce non-linear independent variables in the system so that the multiple linear regression method can use this non-linearity to produce the desired non-linear y_cap. this method is still linear regression but it is linear regression of non-linear independent variables. the method is known as polynomial regression as polynomial terms are introduced as independent variables to handle non-linearity in y. another term is feature engineering in which we introduced additional x variables to improve the performance of ml methods. there are two types of feature engineering 1) forward engineering - it starts with an empty feature set and iteratively adds one feature at a time based on their performance and 2) backward engineering - it starts with a complete set of features and removes features one by one until the model performance reaches a peak. both the techniques have their advantages and disadvantages and can be used in combination to optimise the feature selection process. next we talked about some non-parametric models like random forest, xg boost, knn, etc and their features. some glimpses of neural networks which is an example of parametric models are composed of neuronâ€™s and links with their weights. if we start increasing the layer it becomes deep learning but it needs more and more data but chances of overfitting also increases.
if the difference between r_squared of train and test data is more then it is case of overfitting. by comparing r_squared and mse value we can select best model. next we learned about the classification when y is nominal or ordinal values. if y and x are available then it is supervised learning. in logistic regression which is used for classification creates boundary along the data using sigmoid function.",todayâ€™s class start topic improve quality results 1 improving sample like quality size sample 2 improving method like using multiple methods selecting best one 3 fine tuning methods properly using methods â€” gridsearch new definition linear regression outcome expressed linear combination independent variables using mlr datasets error plot random follows pattern indicates forcing line model results incorrect results need introduce nonlinear independent variables system multiple linear regression method use nonlinearity produce desired nonlinear ycap method still linear regression linear regression nonlinear independent variables method known polynomial regression polynomial terms introduced independent variables handle nonlinearity another term feature engineering introduced additional x variables improve performance ml methods two types feature engineering 1 forward engineering starts empty feature set iteratively adds one feature time based performance 2 backward engineering starts complete set features removes features one one model performance reaches peak techniques advantages disadvantages combination optimise feature selection process next talked nonparametric models like random forest xg boost knn etc features glimpses neural networks parametric models composed neuronâ€™s links weights start increasing layer becomes deep learning needs chances overfitting also increases difference rsquared train test case overfitting comparing rsquared mse value select best model next learned classification nominal ordinal values x available supervised learning logistic regression classification creates boundary along using sigmoid function,211,13,-2.7191143,-9.627125,13,0.7263235,22
228,"linear regression:-
linear regression does not mean that the outcome itself is linear. it means that the outcome is expressed as a linear combination of independent variables.


taylor series expansion:-
a mathematical technique used to express a function as a series expansion.

if errors exhibit specific trends (e.g., sinusoidal patterns), we can introduce new features:
uâ‚ = xâ‚
uâ‚‚ = xâ‚â² (polynomial feature)
uâ‚ƒ = xâ‚â³
uâ‚„ = sin(xâ‚)
generalized as: uâ‚™ = f(xâ‚, ...)

feature selection:-

backward feature elimination:-
eliminates features based on p-values, removing the ones with the highest p-values (typically > 0.05).


forward feature engineering:-
starts with an empty feature set and progressively adds important features to build a more refined model.


backward feature engineering:-
begins with a full feature set and eliminates irrelevant or redundant features.


building a good model:-
a good model should:
avoid excessive unnecessary variables.
prevent overfitting.
ensure generalization.


model selection and explainability:-
we learned about exploratory data analysis (eda) and how to select the best model for a given problem.

parametric vs. non-parametric models:-
parametric models allow for ""what-if"" simulations and interpretability.
non-parametric models are more flexible but may lack explainability.

classification models:-

when predicting classes of categorical variables, we use classification models such as:
logistic regression â†’ determines class probabilities.decision boundaries defines regions where data points belong to a specific class.

272,"
we began by discussing how to improve the quality of a modelâ€™s results. there are three key approaches:  
1. improving the sample â€“ this can be done by either increasing the sample size or enhancing the quality of the sample.  
2. improving the method â€“ using multiple methods and selecting the best one.  
3. fine-tuning the method â€“ properly adjusting and optimizing the selected method.  

we then discussed polynomial regression followed by feature engineering, which consists of:  
- forward selection â€“ adding features one by one.  
- backward selection â€“ starting with all features and removing the ones that arenâ€™t needed.  

after that, we outlined the modeling workflow:  
1. collect data  
2. process data  
3. obtain clean data  
4. apply various models and compare metrics  
5. select the best model  

we also emphasized that if a single model can predict data effectively, it is preferable to using multiple models. we then experimented with different models like linear regression, svm regression, and random forest. the random forest model gave the best results, but we noted that it is a non-parametric model, making it less suitable for tasks like delta analysis (which requires parametric models like linear regression).  

we then introduced neural networks, explaining that they are parametric models as they involve weights. a neural network consists of:  
- input layer  
- hidden layers (where transformations occur: y = f(wixi))  
- output layer  

as the number of hidden layers increases, it transitions into deep learning. we also examined model evaluation using râ² and mse:  
- if training and test râ²/mse are similar, the model is well-fitted.  
- if training error is significantly lower than test error, the model is overfitting.  

lastly, we started with classification, which is used for nominal or ordinal data. in supervised learning, both x (input) and y (output) are available, while regression aims to pull data points back to their mean values. we then covered logistic regression, which is used for classification tasks. it helps define decision boundaries between different classes using the sigmoid function.",began discussing improve quality modelâ€™s results three key approaches 1 improving sample â€“ done either increasing sample size enhancing quality sample 2 improving method â€“ using multiple methods selecting best one 3 finetuning method â€“ properly adjusting optimizing selected method polynomial regression followed feature engineering consists forward selection â€“ adding features one one backward selection â€“ starting features removing ones arenâ€™t needed outlined modeling workflow 1 collect 2 process 3 obtain clean 4 apply models compare metrics 5 select best model also emphasized single model predict effectively preferable using multiple models experimented different models like linear regression svm regression random forest random forest model gave best results noted nonparametric model making less suitable tasks like delta analysis requires parametric models like linear regression introduced neural networks explaining parametric models involve weights neural network consists input layer hidden layers transformations occur fwixi output layer number hidden layers increases transitions deep learning also examined model evaluation using râ² mse training test râ²mse similar model wellfitted training error significantly lower test error model overfitting lastly started classification nominal ordinal supervised learning x input output available regression aims pull points back mean values covered logistic regression classification tasks helps define decision boundaries different classes using sigmoid function,203,13,-0.36709487,-11.674973,13,0.72184813,24
627,"today's lecture begin with a discussion of how to increase the quality of results, there are some methods for it, one of them is by improving the sample (either by upgrading the quality of sample or by increasing the sample size). then we also came to know about what is forward(start with minimal number of features and then increase features based on requirement or according to further domain knowledge) and backward(start with large number of features and then eliminating those which are unwanted) feature engineering. also, it is not necessary that given a data set, only one model will be able to fit the data (i.e., one can fit multiple models for a given dataset based on requirement). after this, we discussed parametric(regression, classification) and non-parametric(random forest, k-nearest neighbor (knn)) models. both this models can predict values, but sometimes non-parametric model unable to find what will be the value at some delta(x). we also had a brief intro on neural networks (like what does it means, how does it works, etc. in short), and like what are links, nodes, weights, features, degrees of freedom, etc. for neural networking systems. the outcome in neural network is a function of weights and features (y_i = f (w_i, x_i)). then, we compared different models like linear regression, svm, random forest, xgboost, knn, neural network, etc.  representing same dataset with the help of r^2 values, rmse, etc., the model with higher r^2 value and lower rmse value is generally a better choice. then we moved on to classification of data (when data is of nominal or ordinal form, classification model is used; when its is of interval or ratio form, regression model is used).
 outcome in classification is called y = class. after this, we first discussed the definition of regression and then what is meant by logistic regression. in logistic regression, we are not interested in finding the best fit line or to predict values, but we are rather interested in finding the boundary between the group/clusters of values. outcome in logistic regression is known as classifiers or class labels. the number or distinct labels = number of boundary lines = number of classes one want to classify. at last, we also discussed the function used by logistic regression to classify the data (in 0/1 or left/right or up/down, etc.) which is called sigmoidal function where outcome is either zero or one based on which class your given value belongs. in order to find a sigmoidal function (s=1/(1-e^(-a))), we need to find weights(w; where a = w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + wnxn) just as we were findings regression coefficients for linear regression.",begin increase quality results methods one improving sample either upgrading quality sample increasing sample size also came know forwardstart minimal number features increase features based requirement according domain knowledge backwardstart large number features eliminating unwanted feature engineering also necessary given set one model able fit ie one fit multiple models given dataset based requirement parametricregression classification nonparametricrandom forest knearest neighbor knn models models predict values sometimes nonparametric model unable find value deltax also brief intro neural networks like means works etc short like links nodes weights features degrees freedom etc neural networking systems outcome neural network function weights features yi f wi xi compared different models like linear regression svm random forest xgboost knn neural network etc representing dataset help r2 values rmse etc model higher r2 value lower rmse value generally choice moved classification nominal ordinal form classification model interval ratio form regression model outcome classification called class first definition regression meant logistic regression logistic regression interested finding best fit line predict values rather interested finding boundary groupclusters values outcome logistic regression known classifiers class labels number distinct labels number boundary lines number classes one want classify last also function logistic regression classify 01 leftright updown etc called sigmoidal function outcome either zero one based class given value belongs order find sigmoidal function s11ea need find weightsw w1x1 w2x2 wnxn findings regression coefficients linear regression,226,13,3.7859836,-11.6349125,13,0.72052616,25

then we took an example where the function looked similar to sine curve and with one feature x1, we engineered other features as x1â²,x1â³,x1â´.this is called polynomial regression.from this we obtained a p-value.then we added another feature which was sin(x1). the p value obtained in second case was found less than that of first case which suggested that the sine feature that was added is significant for this model.however, adding large number of features such that they do not give a better estimation beyond a certain point is not preferred and will decrease the adjusted râ² values.also,if a single model can represent the data good enough then it should always be chosen over having multiple models.
then we discussed about parametric method like neural network. in this there is an input layer which takes in the features and then another layer which performs computations. if computations are performed in multiple layers it is referred to as deep learning. input layer is connected to computational layers through links which represent the degrees of freedom. increasing the degrees of freedom can lead to overfitting.",first looked summaries observed graph number people submitting summaries decreasing average number words summaries increasing took function looked similar sine curve one feature x1 engineered features x1â²x1â³x1â´this called polynomial regressionfrom obtained pvaluethen added another feature sinx1 p value obtained second case found less first case suggested sine feature added significant modelhowever adding large number features give estimation beyond certain point preferred decrease adjusted râ² valuesalsoif single model represent good enough always chosen multiple models parametric method like neural network input layer takes features another layer performs computations computations performed multiple layers referred deep learning input layer connected computational layers links represent degrees freedom increasing degrees freedom lead overfitting,108,13,4.5464807,-6.549741,13,0.7199117,26
234,"the following topics were discussed in today's class:-
1. linear regression with higher order terms: linear regression is just the linear combination of many variables, those variables could be higher powers of the a single independent variable. thus increasing the complexity of the model and its capability to generalize patterns. those higher powers of the same variables are examples of engineered features, this regression with higher order terms is called polynomial regression. we also learnt that based on the problem in hand, one can use more than one models for the same problem.
2. forward and backward feature engineering:  in forward feature engineering the independent variables are chosen one by one with proper analysis. in the other case, all the available variables are added into the model and the redundant ones are removed based on the p-values
3. parametric and non parametric models: in parametric models, the form of the function is assumed with a number of parameters. the ultimate aim of the problem then becomes finding optimal parameters minimizing loss function. these models ability is limited as they can't capture intricate patterns, causing underfitting issues. in case of non-parameteric models, any assumption is not made about the function and the data itself is used to make the prediction. these models have greater complexity and capture patterns better, but have the issue of overfitting. examples like random forest, x-boost, k-nn
4. neural networks: a model having multiple layers connected to each other communicating with each other to finally give a output. if the number of layers is more than one, then it is called deep learning.

536,"we started our lecture with a doubt asked by a student. the question was how to improve the quality of results. we looked at 3 ways which can be used to do this. first is improving the sample. it can be done by either increasing the sample size or by increasing the quality of the sample. second was to improve the method in which we use multiple methods, compare them and select the best one. third one was an extension of the second point which was fine tuning the method which basically means using the method properly. we then began the theory by understanding the fact that multiple linear regression is not regression of linear parameters, but the linear combination of any parameter. we then looked at an example where the error was following some sort of sinusoidal pattern. we took multiple feature like x1 = x1, x2= x1^2, ....., x5 = sin(x1) and by intuition we know that the p values of x1,x2,x3,x4 will be high and that of x5 will be close to a zero. these feature making is called as feature engineering. there are two types of feature engineering - forward and backward. in forward feature engineering, we keep on adding feature one by one till we get a good model. in case of backward feature engineering, we add all the features once and remove irrelevant features one by one. we then started number crunching on excel and looked at models like slr, randomforest, xgboost, knn, neural networks. we looked at how the parametric models can be used for delta analysis and non parametric models like random forest can't. we then had a brief on neural networks where the dependent variable is a function of features and associated weights. neural network consists of nodes and links and they make up hidden layers. if there are more than one hidden layer, it is called as deep learning network. more layers with a small sample leads to overfit. we concluded our lecture with a small introduction to logistic regression, which involves finding boundries for classification.",started doubt asked student question improve quality results looked 3 ways first improving sample done either increasing sample size increasing quality sample second improve method use multiple methods compare select best one third one extension second point fine tuning method basically means using method properly began theory understanding fact multiple linear regression regression linear parameters linear combination parameter looked error following sort sinusoidal pattern took multiple feature like x1 x1 x2 x12 x5 sinx1 intuition know p values x1x2x3x4 high x5 close zero feature making called feature engineering two types feature engineering forward backward forward feature engineering keep adding feature one one till get good model case backward feature engineering add features remove irrelevant features one one started number crunching excel looked models like slr randomforest xgboost knn neural networks looked parametric models delta analysis non parametric models like random forest cant brief neural networks dependent variable function features associated weights neural network consists nodes links make hidden layers one hidden layer called deep learning network layers small sample leads overfit concluded small introduction logistic regression involves finding boundries classification,180,13,-3.3672817,-9.59502,13,0.7115433,29

192,"the lecture discusses two main ways to improve the results of a particular model:

improving the sample: this can be done by making the sample more representative of the data or by increasing the size of the sample. a more representative sample ensures that the model reflects the real-world situation better, while increasing the size of the sample generally helps the model generalize better.

improving the method: this refers to improving the model itself or adjusting hyperparameters, among other things. one example discussed is linear regression, where the outcome is expressed as a linear combination of independent variables. however, to accommodate different types of functions, we can create new independent variables by applying nonlinear transformations to the original variables. for example, the model can be expressed as:
y = î²â‚€ + î²â‚ xâ‚ + î²â‚‚ xâ‚‚ + î²â‚ƒ xâ‚ƒ
where xâ‚‚ = sin(xâ‚) and xâ‚ƒ = xâ‚â².

applying such transformations can make the model more complex, but it also causes the p-value to increase and the adjusted r-squared to decrease, indicating that the model is becoming more unstable. a technique for selecting the right features is backward feature engineering, where we start with all features and remove the least significant ones based on p-values. similarly, there are forward feature engineering and mixed methods to determine the most appropriate set of features to use in a linear regression model.

the lecture then moves on to supervised learning methods, which are generally used to solve various types of problems. for these problems, we gather the data and apply multiple methods to it, eventually selecting the one that gives the best results. sometimes, more than one method might be combined to achieve better performance, such as by averaging the results or using some other approach to integrate the outputs. for example, in the case presented in the slides, the random forest method yields the best results. however, even in such cases, a linear regression model might still be chosen if the priority is expandability, as linear models are often easier to modify and apply to other data.

next, the lecture covers classification, which is another type of supervised learning, where the goal is to predict categorical labels for data. the labels could be binary (yes/no, 0/1) or have multiple categories (such as classifying animals as mammals, reptiles, etc.). the simplest method for classification is logistic regression. in logistic regression, the goal is to separate the space into regions, each corresponding to a different label. in the simplest case, the model can be written as:
a = wâ‚ xâ‚ + wâ‚‚ xâ‚‚ + wâ‚ƒ xâ‚ƒ + v
where a is a linear combination of the input features. to convert this result into a binary label (0 or 1), we apply the sigmoid function:
sigmoid(a) = 1 / (1 + e^(-a))
this function maps the linear combination of features to a value between 0 and 1, which can then be interpreted as the probability of the data belonging to one of the two classes.",discusses two main ways improve results particular model improving sample done making sample representative increasing size sample representative sample ensures model reflects realworld situation increasing size sample generally helps model generalize improving method refers improving model adjusting hyperparameters among things one linear regression outcome expressed linear combination independent variables however accommodate different types functions create new independent variables applying nonlinear transformations original variables model expressed î²â‚€ î²â‚ xâ‚ î²â‚‚ xâ‚‚ î²â‚ƒ xâ‚ƒ xâ‚‚ sinxâ‚ xâ‚ƒ xâ‚â² applying transformations make model complex also causes pvalue increase adjusted rsquared decrease indicating model becoming unstable technique selecting right features backward feature engineering start features remove least significant ones based pvalues similarly forward feature engineering mixed methods determine appropriate set features use linear regression model moves supervised learning methods generally solve types problems problems gather apply multiple methods eventually selecting one gives best results sometimes one method might combined achieve performance averaging results using approach integrate outputs case presented slides random forest method yields best results however even cases linear regression model might still chosen priority expandability linear models often easier modify apply next covers classification another type supervised learning goal predict categorical labels labels could binary yesno 01 multiple categories classifying animals mammals reptiles etc simplest method classification logistic regression logistic regression goal separate space regions corresponding different label simplest case model written wâ‚ xâ‚ wâ‚‚ xâ‚‚ wâ‚ƒ xâ‚ƒ v linear combination input features convert result binary label 0 1 apply sigmoid function sigmoida 1 1 ea function maps linear combination features value 0 1 interpreted probability belonging one two classes,258,13,-1.795978,-10.001553,13,0.71010816,31
413,"first, we looked at all the summaries. we had a pattern where the number of people submitting summaries decreased as sessions went on while the average words per summary were increasing.

the second case that we looked into was when the function was looking more like a sine curve. in this case, we only used one feature, x1 but used more polynomial features like x1^2,x1^3, x1^4, using polynomial regression to get a good fit. this model gave us a p-value. to further improve the model, we added a new feature, sin x1. in this second case, the resulting p-value was lower than in the first case. this means that the sine feature was statistically significant and improved the model's performance. however, adding too many features beyond a certain point does not necessarily improve the estimation and can lead to a decline in adjusted râ² values. in general, if we can fit the data using a single model, it should be preferred over the fit using multiple models. we then discussed parametric methods, including neural networks.

in these models, an input layer takes in features, which are passed through computational layers. when computations happen across more than one layer, it is called deep learning. the input layer is connected to computational layers in a way representing the degrees of freedom. while increasing these degrees of freedom may improve prediction it also means that there is an increased chance of overfitting, which is the model overly fits the training data and, therefore underfits new data.",first looked summaries pattern number people submitting summaries decreased sessions went average words per increasing second case looked function looking like sine curve case one feature x1 polynomial features like x12x13 x14 using polynomial regression get good fit model gave us pvalue improve model added new feature sin x1 second case resulting pvalue lower first case means sine feature statistically significant improved models performance however adding many features beyond certain point necessarily improve estimation lead decline adjusted râ² values general fit using single model preferred fit using multiple models parametric methods including neural networks models input layer takes features passed computational layers computations happen across one layer called deep learning input layer connected computational layers way representing degrees freedom increasing degrees freedom may improve prediction also means increased chance overfitting model overly fits training therefore underfits new,137,13,4.4186645,-6.58241,13,0.70993686,32
103,"touched upon how taylor expansion allows functions of x to be expressed as linear combination of powers of x

when we have just one independent variable to describe y- why not allow more variables to be included?- make variables as powers of x

this is the basis of polynomial regression

introduced to backward and forward selection
backward- get all features and keep eliminating features one-by-one

get data- preprocess- good data- multiple methods- compare- select best

is fitting one model necessary- answer is still ambiguous to me.

looked into a lot of models- like slr, svm, random forest, knn, ann and more
we were simultaneously classifying the models as parametric v/s non-parametric models

random forest good for prediction for the value of y, but lets say we want to find the delta that is change in y as we change x, then rf is not as helpful

what are neural networks?

what does the word regress mean- ""coming back to mediocrity"" (found this definition quite interesting)

logistic regression is about finding boundariesâ€¨classifier- gives you the boundary

once the model is made ie., the boundaries are determined we proceed by assigning metrics- false positive; false negative

labels: # distinct labels = # distinct classes

we are not predicting a continuous value here

we can very well have a line defining the boundary between the clusters

sigmoid function- gives 0 or 1 value- like a switch
s(a) is this functionâ€¨

65,"today's session basically started off with some review of the previous lectures, where we discussed that how if the error plot is not random, and shows some non linear relation i.e. if there is a non linear relation between the independent and dependent variable, then we need to introduce polynomials of the independent variable also as features to our model. this is part of feature engineering, and using polynomial functions of the independent variable as a feature for the mlr model, is known as polynomial regression. we also discussed how any non-linear and non-polynomial relation (eg. sin, cos, log) can also be converted to a polynomial relation using taylor series expansion. we also learnt that even complex neural networks employed some kind of polynomial regression itself, in order to make good predictions.
then we moved on to data which displays different kinds of relation in different ranges. we saw that we could use a variety of models for such data, and we could even use multiple models for a single dataset in case there was a completely different relation. however using one single model for the entire dataset is always more beneficial and easier than using multiple models, as it will create complications when implementing for the test dataset. also in such cases, we concluded that the best method of finding out the best model for our data was to try out all possible models and then choose the one with the best prediction accuracy according to us. we saw the responses of various models over a dataset and we observed that even though one model (random forest) was fitting our data highly accurately, we observed that it might be too good a fit for our model to be able to make any useful predictions on the test data. however, some other models, although not fitting the data that accurately, were doing quite well at prediction as compared to random forest. hence, choosing them would be a better choice than choosing a model which accurately fits our data but is not able to make accurate predictions. 
we then moved on to logistic regression and classification. we noted that this scheme applies to nominal and ordinal levels of measurement and not to ratios as classes are discrete and need to be dealt with in that manner itself. we also said that unlike linear regression, logistic regression was not meant to predict the data values, but rather the class in which an observation belonged. the output of such a model is the class, and we are basically trying to predict the boundaries between the classes. the expression for calculation is somewhat similar to that of linear regression, however in this case, we use weights instead of coefficients (beta) as per the nomenclature. the idea behind both the regression algorithms was similar; to reach a mean or mediocre value. in linear regression we were trying to predict the value of data points based on the mean of observations, whereas here, we are trying to find the mean boundary between classes so that we can accurately classify our observation points.

some error metrics like rmse and mae may have a physical meaning as they have the same dimension as the data but others like sse and mse are used only form 'optimization purposes'. also, these values themselves may not be very helpful, but they aid in model selection; we decide which model is better based on these metric (lower is better for error and higher is better for something else).
even when metrics such as r-squared and f-statistic are high, the model may still be bad. saw an example where the regression coefficients were statistically equal to zero. after performing some feature selection (successively dropping the ones with the highest p-value) we become more confident with the model even though the value of the metrics may have decreased slightly.
mlr doesn't have a closed form solution hence we need to use gradient descent to arrive at a solution (that is potentially correct). it is similar to newton-rhapson method. we start with a randomly initialized value as the answer and the iteratively move towards the 'optimal' solution. multiple solvers are available that implement some form of gradient descent and it forms an integral part in the functioning of many machine learning algorithms / techniques.",multiple linear regression multiple predictor variables also called features stuff use features calculate derive features using domain knowledge form known feature engineering error metrics like rmse mae may physical meaning dimension others like sse mse form optimization purposes also values may helpful aid model selection decide model based metric lower error higher something else even metrics rsquared fstatistic high model may still bad saw regression coefficients statistically equal zero performing feature selection successively dropping ones highest pvalue become confident model even though value metrics may decreased slightly mlr doesnt closed form solution hence need use gradient descent arrive solution potentially correct similar newtonrhapson method start randomly initialized value answer iteratively move towards optimal solution multiple solvers available implement form gradient descent forms integral part functioning many machine learning algorithms techniques,130,15,-6.5569086,-6.7329826,13,0.68980587,39

then, we analyzed a dataset containing both linear and non-linear trends. among the four models we tested, random forest, knn, and ann effectively captured the trend.
then, we analyzed r-squared and mean squared error (mse) for our models. we observed that xgboost outperformed random forest. knn, being less complex, provided better results, making it a suitable choice for our dataset.

finally, we discussed neural networks, where input features pass through computational layers. stacking these layers forms deep learning, but excessive complexity that is increasing deg if freedom can cause overfitting.

82,"the session started with a question of how to improve the quality of the results. one solution is to improve the sample. to improve the sample, we can either increase the sample size or increase the sample quality. but how do we know if the sample selected is of good quality. another way to improve the quality of result is to improve the method. we can use multiple method and then select the best one. but we noticed that if the nature of data changes, then even the best method may not be the best for the new data. another solution to improve quality is to fine tune or properly use the method. 
then we went back to mlr. the base idea is that in multiple linear regression the outcome may not be linear but linear combination of independent variables. 
then we saw a sample. after the regression the error showed a specific pattern like a function or polynomial. for such cases we can use polynomial regression where we create new parameter x1, x2, x3, x4, which are polynomial or function of original x parameter. ex. if the error shows the pattern like a sine function, then taking x4 = sin(x) can be helpful. and now in mlr, the coefficient for sine function should appear significant and other all parameters should drop. 
it is not possible that we get a 100% accurate model. but at least we should try there should not be too many features and overfitting. 
then we discussed in short about forward feature engineering and backward feature engineering. 
though, we can use multiple models to extract data but it always better to have a single model. 
then we analyzed several models together. models were like random forest and neural network.

the lecture began with an recap of multiple linear regression did in last lecture , where we have multiple independent variables (x_1, x_2, x_3, ... x_n). although multicollinearity is an important consideration, it was noted that this would be discussed later.  

next, we covered the concept of training and test data, emphasizing that the entire sample should not be used to train the machine learning model. a typical 80-20% split (80% training, 20% testing) was recommended, as a 50-50% split might lead to an unrepresentative training sample.  

we then discussed two outcome sets: training matrix and test matrix. for the training matrix, we introduced the concept of the confidence interval. this led to a discussion on overfitting, which occurs when training accuracy is much higher than test accuracy. a graphical representation was used to illustrate this issue.  

after this, we performed regression statistics in excel. several key terms were defined:  
- multiple r: the square root of r^2 (coefficient of determination), which provides a measure of the nonlinear correlation between y and the independent variables.  
- adjusted r^2 the formula for adjusted r^2 was explained.  
- the denominator in variance formulas: we examined why it is n-1 instead of (n)due to degrees of freedom being reduced when using the mean of x.  

we clarified that linear regression does not necessarily imply a straight line, but rather a linear relationship between yand x 

towards the end, we transitioned to python programming for linear regression. several statistical tests were covered, including:  
- omnibus test and its p-value criteria
- skewness and kurtosis statistics
- durbin-watson test for autocorrelation  

additionally, we discussed quantile-quantile (q-q) plots, which help assess whether a dataset follows a particular distribution by dividing the sample distribution curve into sections.

606,"in today's session we discussed briefly about closed form solutions for mlr where we got to know that these solutions exist but we don't use them because of the large size of the matrices and computing the inverses of those matrices would consume too much time and computational power and also because multicollinearity exists between two or more variables. when we want to generalise our model for the entire population but we dont have access to entire population's data so the sample we have is divided into train and test data. depending upon the size of the sample we can choose different proportions of train and test data. some parameters used for training data might not be used for the test data like the ci and other error metrics like sse and tse. we use mostly r squared value and mae or rmse to decide if our model is working good enough on the unseen(test data). an overfit model fails to generalise for unseen data and hence lacks the ability to perform good on the test data. adjusted r^2 value is used for mlr to see if our r^2 value is increasing significantly when we add a new variable and that helps us to decide how many independent variables we would want to have in our data. also the term linear regression does not always result in a straight line, it just means that the dependent variable would be a linear combination of all the independent variables. also we later jumped into python and see how to code for a lr problem using different libraries like pandas, matplotlib, sklearn etc and their functions. for a problem we have we should always try to solve the problem with different models and decide which one's better in terms of the less error values and more accurate results.",briefly closed form solutions mlr got know solutions exist dont use large size matrices computing inverses matrices would consume much time computational power also multicollinearity exists two variables want generalise model entire population dont access entire populations sample divided train test depending upon size sample choose different proportions train test parameters training might test like ci error metrics like sse tse use mostly r squared value mae rmse decide model working good enough unseentest overfit model fails generalise unseen hence lacks ability perform good test adjusted r2 value mlr see r2 value increasing significantly add new variable helps us decide many independent variables would want also term linear regression always result straight line means dependent variable would linear combination independent variables also later jumped python see code lr problem using different libraries like pandas matplotlib sklearn etc functions problem always try solve problem different models decide ones terms less error values accurate results,153,14,-1.9941407,2.2706025,14,0.79531306,6
87,"in this session, we learned about multiple linear regression (mlr) and how it works in real-world scenarios. while there is a mathematical formula to solve mlr, it involves complex calculations and isnâ€™t always practical. a key challenge in mlr is multi-collinearity, where some input variables are too closely related, which can make predictions less reliable.

to build a good model, we donâ€™t use the entire dataset for training. instead, we split it into 80% for training and 20% for testing. this helps us check if the model can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. we also talked about overfitting, which happens when a model performs well on training data but fails to predict new data correctly.

we explored key performance measures like multiple r (which shows how strongly the inputs and output are related) and adjusted r2 (which checks if adding more variables actually improves the model). we also discussed why, in statistics, we divide by n-1 instead of n when calculating standard deviation.

linear regression is a parametric method, meaning it works based on fixed formulas and p-values. in contrast, non-parametric methods rely on different performance measures like r2 and mean squared error (mse). we also touched on data drift, which happens when data patterns change over time, making old models less effective.

finally, we implemented mlr in python using the ordinary least squares (ols) method, giving us hands-on experience with how regression models are built and analyzed.

136,"in today's class we learn more about the regression through python modules. the very basic theory is that do not use the entire sample for creating the model. we split the data in the ratio of 80:20 to training and testing samples. this splitting helps model to perform well as compared to using the whole sample. and we done this process by randomly splitting.
from training matrics and testing matrics we get r_2. if the value of r_2 is differing much from each other then it performs well on training and testing data but not on test data.
this is called overfitting. another term is bias variance tradeoff. multiple r which is square root of r_2 which indicates correlation between y and rest of the x. the adjusted r_2 value will drop if we are adding the variables and it tells how effective the addition of new variables is. slr and mlr are parametric method of model creation as they use parametrs.

402,"after exploratory data analysis on our dataset, we split the data into two classes: 80% for training and 20% for testing. training data was used to create a linear regression model, and hence, we had two key sets of output metricsâ€”training results and testing results.

overfitting was discussed as a potential issue in model performance. this arises when the model performs well with the training data but poorly on the testing data, which gives an indication that the model learns specific patterns specific to the training data rather than generalizable trends.

we also discussed the idea of adjusted râ². while regular râ² increases with each additional predictor, adjusted râ² adjusts for the number of predictors in a model and provides a better measure of the fit of the model. this value gives us the amount of variance explained per degree of freedom, giving a more realistic view of model fit.

linear regression models: simple linear regression (slr) and multiple linear regression (mlr) were covered. these are parametric models that depend upon the use of p-values, coefficients like î²â‚ and other statistical measures in order to understand the relationships between the variables.

we then looked at how to determine if errors are normally distributed. a q-q plot, or quantile-quantile plot, is used for this purpose. if the error values fall along a straight line in the q-q plot, it suggests that the errors are normally distributed, which is an assumption of linear regression.

the session explained the basic setup of scikit-learn, or simply sklearn, the python library for building and evaluating ml models. in this session, we learned how to use this tool to successfully implement linear regression.

hypothesis testing: the session concluded with an introduction to hypothesis testing, including an overview of p-values. we touched on some common statistical tests, including the omnibus test, jarque-bera test, and durbin-watson test. these tests help assess the underlying assumptions and validity of the model, such as checking for autocorrelation, normality of residuals, and other model fit aspects.",exploratory analysis dataset split two classes 80 training 20 testing training create linear regression model hence two key sets output metricsâ€”training results testing results overfitting potential issue model performance arises model performs well training poorly testing gives indication model learns specific patterns specific training rather generalizable trends also idea adjusted râ² regular râ² increases additional predictor adjusted râ² adjusts number predictors model provides measure fit model value gives us amount variance explained per degree freedom giving realistic view model fit linear regression models simple linear regression slr multiple linear regression mlr covered parametric models depend upon use pvalues coefficients like î²â‚ statistical measures order understand relationships variables looked determine errors normally distributed qq plot quantilequantile plot purpose error values fall along straight line qq plot suggests errors normally distributed assumption linear regression explained basic setup scikitlearn simply sklearn python library building evaluating ml models learned use tool successfully implement linear regression hypothesis testing concluded introduction hypothesis testing including overview pvalues touched common statistical tests including omnibus test jarquebera test durbinwatson test tests help assess underlying assumptions validity model checking autocorrelation normality residuals model fit aspects,185,14,-5.084462,2.251476,14,0.7671206,9

explained how multicollinearity can be a problem and why we cant solve mlr by closed form solution. the exact form (xtx)^-1... type form.-> impractical, inverse matrix is very hard to compute for so many features and higher number of data. hence we need to shift to gradient descent for reduction of computation.

splitting of data: we split a sample. do not consider a whole sample for training purpose. around 80%-20% split? why? because we want to test the model whether it is really eefective om the unseen data or not.

why not 50-50? why 80-20? we want the data on which the model is going to be trained to be representative enough of the data for variance or complexity capturing.

two sets of outcomes: -training metric and test metrics. training metrics include sse,rmse, f-statistics, r^2. test metrics also include various operation like accuracy r^2.

overfitting: if the r^2 test is significantly lower than r^2 training. model is not generalized.

then we tried mlr on excel. showed result. did the analysis. various things we found out.  multiple r -> sqrt(r^2), correlation of y and all the (x1,x2..) taken all together.(non regression statistical result resemble)
adjusted r^2: gives you an idea. how effective the addition of new independent variable is.
1-[(sse/its respective dof)/(sst/its dof)]  we divide by degree of freedom because we want to get the adjusted equivalent r^2 if there was one independent feature. dof is n-1 for sst because considering the mean is known. similarly for sse its n-k-1.

497,"this lecture focuses on multiple linear regression (mlr) and its implementation in python.  while mlr has a closed-form solution, it's computationally expensive for large datasets. therefore, gradient descent is the preferred optimization method.

a crucial practice in machine learning is splitting the available data into training and testing sets.  a common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing, performed randomly.  this allows for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.  two sets of evaluation metrics are generated: one for the training data and one for the test data. a good model exhibits strong performance on both sets.  if the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data, it's a sign of overfitting. conversely, poor performance on both sets indicates underfitting.

the ""multiple r"" metric is simply the square root of r-squared.  it represents the correlation between the multiple independent variables (x) and the dependent variable (y).  adjusted r-squared is a modified version of r-squared, calculated using the residual sum of squares (rss) and the total sum of squares (tss).  the formula incorporates  n-1 (degrees of freedom) because we lose a degree of freedom for each estimated parameter. adjusted r-squared penalizes the model if the rss doesn't decrease sufficiently relative to the increase in the number of predictors.  it helps to prevent overfitting by considering model complexity.  it's important to remember that mlr doesn't always result in a straight line; it can model more complex relationships.

the lecture then transitions to implementing mlr in python using the sklearn library.  sklearn is excellent for model building, predictions, and handling large datasets.  however, it can lack fine-grained control for researchers needing detailed model analysis.  to assess the model's fit, the distribution of residuals (errors) is examined using a histogram and a q-q plot.  ideally, the residuals should be normally distributed.

for more in-depth analysis, the statsmodels library is introduced.  statsmodels provides access to a wider range of statistical metrics.  one such metric is the ""omnibus"" test, which combines skewness and kurtosis to assess how closely the residuals approximate a normal distribution.  the jarque-bera test is another normality test for residuals.  a desirable outcome is a non-significant p-value (typically greater than 0.05) and a test statistic below a certain threshold (e.g., 2), indicating that the residuals are likely normally distributed.",focuses multiple linear regression mlr implementation python mlr closedform solution computationally expensive large datasets therefore gradient descent preferred optimization method crucial practice machine learning splitting available training testing sets common split 80 training 20 testing performed randomly allows evaluating models performance unseen two sets evaluation metrics generated one training one test good model exhibits strong performance sets model performs well training poorly test sign overfitting conversely poor performance sets indicates underfitting multiple r metric simply square root rsquared represents correlation multiple independent variables x dependent variable adjusted rsquared modified version rsquared calculated using residual sum squares rss total sum squares tss formula incorporates n1 degrees freedom lose degree freedom estimated parameter adjusted rsquared penalizes model rss doesnt decrease sufficiently relative increase number predictors helps prevent overfitting considering model complexity important remember mlr doesnt always result straight line model complex relationships transitions implementing mlr python using sklearn library sklearn excellent model building predictions handling large datasets however lack finegrained control researchers needing detailed model analysis assess models fit distribution residuals errors examined using histogram qq plot ideally residuals normally distributed indepth analysis statsmodels library introduced statsmodels provides access wider range statistical metrics one metric omnibus test combines skewness kurtosis assess closely residuals approximate normal distribution jarquebera test another normality test residuals desirable outcome nonsignificant pvalue typically greater 005 test statistic certain threshold eg 2 indicating residuals likely normally distributed,228,14,-4.684139,1.7830684,14,0.75571966,12

489,"for multiple linear regression, the closed form solution for b exists but it might be impractical to calculate these as matrix inversions might not exist and etc. if we have a sample of data, we should not use the entire data for creating the ml model. we need to split the data into two parts in the ratio 80%-training data and 20%-testing data. this splitting has to be done randomly. two sets of outcomes that we have to derive and measure: training metrics and test metrics. some of metrics will only be relevant to the training data but may not have any meaning for test data. as we are building model using the training data there are some metrics which are suitable for this only. overfit  situation: when r square value of training data is much greater(generally a difference grater than 0.2) than r squared value of test data. the training errors maybe less but test errors will be too much in case of overfitting. this is a practical tradeoff how much error we are allowing for test data and training data. both these errors are important. as we add more variables, r square value increases. this doesnot mean that the data is better fit. so we introduce a adjusted r square value which is the part of variance captured by each independent variable. n-1 comes in the denominator of calculations involving variance and standard deviation. the calculation of variance involves mean of x. this is already calculated using all n variables. this reduces one degree of freedom and it becomes n-1. the outcome of a linear regression need not always be straight line. slr and mlr are called parametric methods of model creation. there are non parametric methods of model creation. data drift- if we create a model now, the data coming after one month maybe far away from this model. so we have to change our models also frequently according to the data. then we shifted on to python. sir explained how to do multiple linear regression in python. q-q plot tells us how much our data is similar to normal distribution. regression model can be imported from scipy or stats model libraries. sm.ols: sm-statsmodel, ols-optimised least square. stats model gives more statistical measures and parameter than scipy. low values of aic and bic are better. aic and bic are to be discussed later. omnibus statistics, omnibus p value, skewness. we cant use the old p value everywhere. we need to use different type of p-value. omnibus- normality of distribuition. jarque - bera test- check the normality of residuals. durbin watson test tries to asses based on value of error can we predict next error or kind of autocorrelation in the residuals of the models.

96,"for a mlr, in theory, closed form solution exists but in practicality, the closed form solution is not taken into consideration due to two reasons 1. finding inverse of large matrices is difficult and 2. there can be multi-collinearity. from a population we take sample, but in order to train ml model, entire sample should not be used. after cleaning and examining the sample, it should be divided in 80:20 ratio; 80% sample should be used to train the model (this sample data is known as training data) and the rest 20% sample should be used for testing purpose to check how well the model can predict the data (this is known as testing data or unseen data). then we discussed what is meant by overfit situation : (case1: râ²_trn=0.95 & râ²_tst=0.75, in this case the model is able to fit the training data, but is unable to predict the test data well; case2: râ²_trn=0.95 & râ²_tst=0.88, in this case the model is able to fit the training data and is able to predict the test data as well), in the above example, case1 is overfit situation, and in case2, ml model is good. after this, there was a discussion on different râ² values, i.e., like what is meant by multiple râ², râ², adjusted râ², etc. and what are their significance. also, we came to know that linear regression do not always mean fitting a straight line (linear is not for straight line), it is called linear regression because it uses linear combination of independent variables. then we discussed what are parametric models(slr & mlr which uses p-value for its operations and prediction) and non-parametric models(decision tree and random forest which rely on râ², rmse, mse ,etc. values for predicting outcomes).then we jumped into python discussed its two library 1. sklearnt and 2. statsmodel.api ; we also discussed q-q plot (quantile-quantile plot) in order to judge the that are the residuals normally distributed or not.

471,"in real life we should never use the entire sample for training the model, instead randomly take some (practically 20%) of the data and treat it as test data unseen by the model. this is used to compare the performance of different we may create to solve the problem.
multiple r is nothing but the square root of the r^2 metric for the case of mlr, and it represents some form of correlation between y and all of the x.
linear regression only means that we will solve for a linear combination of the features, it does not restrain what those features may be, and whether the trend of the predictions will be linear (line or hyperplane) or not.
the matrix form doesn't restrict y to be just one row / column, it can also be a matrix, in which case we would just be predicting multiple outputs from the features.
if we know the mean, then one of the sample loses its value, and hence we say that the degrees of freedom are reduced when we are calculating the values of ssr and sst because both formulas require the mean of something. when we divide them by their respective degrees of freedom and then use them to calculate r^2, it is called adjusted r^2.

multiple r (the square root of r^2) tells us how strongly the independent and dependent variables are related.....in linear regression, we can have multiple input variables (features) and even multiple outputs, which means we often solve the problem using matrices.

when analyzing variance, we want to know how much each independent variable contributes. the concept of degrees of freedom comes into play hereâ€”since we use the sample mean, we effectively lose one degree of freedom. because both ssr (sum of squares for regression) and sst (total sum of squares) involve the mean, we adjust for this in the formula for adjusted râ²:

adjusted r^2 = 1 - ((ssr/(n-k-1))/(sst/(n-1)))

then sir said that we should never use the entire data for taining our model. after cleaning our data (which would be most of the task that we would do in data science) we should split the the data into two parts - training data and testing data. now the question arises what should be the ratio of volume of the two parts? it should be 80-20. we can keep 50-50 but that won't be enough to train our model and this much data won't be enough to represent the entire population.
how to split data? there are functions in python which do this. sir also said that people who are not familiar with python should start working on it.
then sir talked about overfitting of data and gave us example of the worst case of over fiting.

if r-square values are near then over fitting issue won't occur. i am talking about the r-square values of training and testing metrics. sir also gave a formula for adjusted r which is mentioned in notes which has degree of freedom and tss and rss. i don't know much about the notation because in the last semester (in ai/ds) the notation was a bit different so of you are reading this please check notation.

262,"at the start of class, we derived the closed form solution for mlr and showed that they are possible only in theory and not in practice. later, sir showed his data analysis on previous class's summary. this time the heatmap was more red than the previous one and only two similar submissions. sir showed us the two similar submission and we notice how even the text were written differently, ai tools could figure out that they are similar in meaning and understanding. 
we moved on to the topic of sample. we learned that if we have a sample, we should not entirely use it to train a model. we should always split the sample in two parts: one for training the model and the other for testing the model. this splitting, however, depends on the quantity of available data and the model. 
we noticed that even if we separate the sample in two parts, it is possible that the testing data may not give predictions with similar accuracy like that of the training data. this depends on the r-square values for the training and testing data. if the r-square values are nearby, only then will we get desired results. we also studied that r-square value for the training data is not desired to be one, because it will not be compatible to the testing data otherwise. 
we understood the terminology for r-square, adjusted r-square and multiple r. we how using (n-1) in calculated adjusted r-square would not be a biased estimator. 
in mlr model, the outcome of the linear regression need not to be linear. it would be the linear combination of independent variables. 
we moved on to the python-based approach for data analysis. we used two new modules: scklearn and statsmodel for analysing data. scklearn do not give parametric values liek r-square, p-value for its model. these values can be obtained in statsmodel. 
we also learned how the previous observation that 'p-value less than 0.5 is desired' can lead us in trouble during hypothesis testing.

419,"today we continued discussing the implications of the different statistical measures of the population parameters. we briefly discussed confidence intervals and then we went into a discussion of multiple regression. in many real-world scenarios, a single explanatory variable is insufficient to model an outcome accurately. simple linear regression, which models a dependent variable y as a function of a single independent variable x, assumes that y is only influenced by one factor. however, most processes are multifactorial, meaning multiple variables interact to determine the outcome. consider the standard simple regression model: y=beta0+beta1x+epsilon, where epsilon represents random error. this approach assumes that all variation in y can be explained by x, which is often too simplistic.

now, if multiple factors influence y, we need a multiple regression model:
y=beta0+beta1x1+beta2x2+â‹¯+betanxn+îµ, where x1,x2,â€¦,xnx1â€‹,x2â€‹,â€¦,xnâ€‹ are different independent variables. this allows us to capture more complex relationships between data. excel's toolpak enables multiple regression as well. we get f-statistics for multiple regression but we have not discussed that in detail yet.",continued discussing implications different statistical measures population parameters briefly confidence intervals went multiple regression many realworld scenarios single explanatory variable insufficient model outcome accurately simple linear regression models dependent variable function single independent variable x assumes influenced one factor however processes multifactorial meaning multiple variables interact determine outcome consider standard simple regression model ybeta0beta1xepsilon epsilon represents random error approach assumes variation explained x often simplistic multiple factors influence need multiple regression model ybeta0beta1x1beta2x2â‹¯betanxnîµ x1x2â€¦xnx1â€‹x2â€‹â€¦xnâ€‹ different independent variables allows us capture complex relationships excels toolpak enables multiple regression well get fstatistics multiple regression detail yet,94,3,-14.01669,-3.7416186,14,0.52413476,35
35,"we talked about predicting things using several factors. this is called multiple linear regression.  we use different inputs (like x1, x2, etc.) to predict an outcome (y).  the basic idea is:

y = a0 + a1x1 + a2x2 + â€¦ + anxn

we also use the f-value to see how accurate our prediction is. it compares how much of the variation we explain to how much we don't. a higher f-value usually means a better model which predicts.

10,"the lecture began with a recap of confidence intervals. using an example, we analyzed points a and b within the confidence interval range to determine whether they were truly distinct or if their values appeared by chance. another point, d, which was outside the confidence interval, was identified as statistically significant. since the probability of obtaining d from the sample was very low, we concluded that it was statistically different from a and b.  

next, we introduced embedding vectors as a way to process data. we converted data into vectors that included various features, allowing for feature engineering.  

following this, we discussed multiple linear regression (mlr). the objective of mlr is to express a dependent variable (y) as a linear combination of independent features (xâ‚, xâ‚‚, xâ‚ƒ, ...). like simple linear regression, mlr aims to minimize the sum of squared errors to determine the best-fit coefficients for the features in the model.  

the lecture then covered the matrices used in the derivation of mlr and the cost function which helps quantify the error. the gradient descent process was then introduced to optimize the model parameters.  

we also discussed the f-value, calculated as the mean square regression (msr) divided by the mean square error (mse). a higher f-value indicates a better model fit.  

next, we explored the role of the p-value in multiple linear regression. if a feature's p-value is greater than 0.05, it suggests that zero falls within the confidence interval, meaning that the feature is not statistically significant. based on this, we learned that features with high p-values can be dropped from the model, as their presence does not significantly impact the predictions. features with the highest p-values are the least significant and should be removed to improve the model's efficiency.

207,"in today's class, we began with summarizing the learnings from the previous class. for y = b0 + b1x; we saw that b1 is more important than b0 because with b0 being zero, we at least have b1 which gives a slope for the regression. we discussed what statistically same and statistically significant means. we studied what happens when zero is the interval depending on which we can say if two values a and b are distinct or obtained by chance. if zero lies in the interval, then the values obtained are just by chance. as the models are similar to one another in the interval; the values obtained for a and b could have been zero. later, sir showed the class his interesting plot from class data. he used nlp and heatmaps to find the similarity in student's submissions. later, the class proceeded with multiple linear regression. in multiple linear regression, we have more than one independent variable. to extract information from text, we need to create feature out of it. this technique that deals with features is feature engineering. we need to create additional features from the data, because sometimes we may be given data about 'x', but we need information of its derivative. so, we create a feature of its derivative. 
we then studied the mlr gradient descent method and how it correlates the beta values, y-values, x-values and errors. from the data analysis toolpack, we studied the impact of different independent variables, on the f-value, p-value and r-sqaure terms. we notice that some independent variables do not contribute significantly to the regression process and hence we can omit them.",class began summarizing learnings previous class b0 b1x saw b1 important b0 b0 zero least b1 gives slope regression statistically statistically significant means studied happens zero interval depending say two values b distinct obtained chance zero lies interval values obtained chance models similar one another interval values obtained b could zero later sir showed class interesting plot class nlp heatmaps find similarity students submissions later class proceeded multiple linear regression multiple linear regression one independent variable extract information text need create feature technique deals features feature engineering need create additional features sometimes may given x need information derivative create feature derivative studied mlr gradient descent method correlates beta values yvalues xvalues errors analysis toolpack studied impact different independent variables fvalue pvalue rsqaure terms notice independent variables contribute significantly regression process hence omit,132,15,-9.187877,-5.063828,15,0.7566491,3
392,"we started the lecture by having a quick recap of the concepts from the previous class. we discussed what we exactly mean by saying â€˜a given number is statistically significant/ a number is not statistically different from 0â€™. we then started with a new topic- multiple linear regression. before starting, we discussed that before performing mlr, we need to convert the file/ data available to us in a vector form - [x1,x2,x3â€¦]. this vector contains various features of the data. this process is called as â€˜embedding vectorâ€™. sometimes, we also need to derive some new features based on the given ones, which matter more/ are more relevant in the context. so, this process of transforming the already existing features or performing operations on the existing features, so as to get new features, is known as â€˜feature engineeringâ€™.
we saw that we donâ€™t get a closed form solution for the coefficient values in mlr, like that in slr. however, the procedure needed to perform to obtain their values remains the same. like slr, in mlr also, we try to minimize the sum of squares of errors. so, if we have â€˜kâ€™ such independent variables/ features, we get â€˜kâ€™ such equations, on which we perform numerical methods to get the solutions. we also learnt about a statistic called the â€˜f-statisticâ€™. it is the ratio of average variance explained by our regression model to the variance explained by errors. so, we want most of our variations to be explained by the regression model. hence, we want msr to be greater than mse, which means f-statistic should be as large as possible. we learnt that the error metrics that we use to assess the validity of a model, are better interpreted when used to compare different models, rather than using it within the same model. also, since rmse and mae are in the same dimensions as the data, they are easier to interpret or relate as compared to other metrics, like sse, mse. 
in any ml model we first start by assuming that the errors in the predicted and actual data values are random. also, for any ml model, if more independent variables are available then the value of r2 increases, since more variables are available to explain the variability in the data. at last, we saw how we can use the p values for each independent variable to assess whether it has any effect on the data. if we get the p-value >0.025 (for 95% interval) then we can say that this particular coefficient is not statistically different from â€˜0â€™. hence, we can ignore it and reduce the number of independent variables in the regression model. we can continue this until we get only those variables whose p -values are <0.025. this implies that only these coefficients are significant and rest can be neglected. this gives us the true/ actual model.

600,"consider a sample s1 from a population. we used this data to fit a line using linear regression. we have a value of a (y=ax+b). we then estimate the 95% confidence interval of a. any two values which lie in the 95% confidence interval are considered statistically similar and not significant. because a value outside the 95% confidence interval has very low chance of occurring it is statistically significant. in linear regression we don't want value of a to be zero . so for a good model we want zero to lie outside 95% ci.

306,"in todayâ€™s session, we covered key statistical concepts and techniques used in data analysis and machine learning:

95% confidence interval & interpretation â€“ we discussed the 95% confidence interval for î²â‚ (beta1), which helps us understand the range in which the true value of a predictorâ€™s coefficient is likely to fall, with 95% confidence. this means if we repeat the sampling process multiple times, 95 out of 100 times, the coefficient will lie within this interval.

multiple linear regression â€“ this technique extends simple linear regression by using multiple independent variables to predict a dependent variable. it allows us to analyze the combined effect of multiple factors on an outcome, making it more powerful for real-world data analysis.

feature engineering â€“ we learned how to improve model performance by transforming raw data into meaningful features. this includes techniques like encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical data, and creating interaction terms to enhance predictive accuracy.",todayâ€™s covered key statistical concepts techniques analysis machine learning 95 confidence interval interpretation â€“ 95 confidence interval î²â‚ beta1 helps us understand range true value predictorâ€™s coefficient likely fall 95 confidence means repeat sampling process multiple times 95 100 times coefficient lie within interval multiple linear regression â€“ technique extends simple linear regression using multiple independent variables predict dependent variable allows us analyze combined effect multiple factors outcome making powerful realworld analysis feature engineering â€“ learned improve model performance transforming raw meaningful features includes techniques like encoding categorical variables scaling numerical creating interaction terms enhance predictive accuracy,97,15,-11.477165,-4.727708,15,0.72662646,11
540,"statistical significance vs. statistical similarity:-
statistically significant: indicates that the observed result is unlikely to be due to random chance, suggesting the effect or difference is meaningful.
statistically similar: implies no significant difference between the groups being compared, meaning the results are likely due to random variability rather than a true effect.

multiple linear regression (mlr):-
embedding vector: in machine learning, text is converted into vectors to allow models to process and learn from textual data.

feature and feature engineering:-
understanding and creating features is essential for building effective models. this involves selecting, transforming, and generating features that improve model performance.

slr (simple linear regression) vs. mlr (multiple linear regression):-
unlike simple linear regression, mlr does not have a closed-form solution for parameters. instead, an iterative approach is used to estimate the parameters.

gradient descent:-
this method is used to minimize error by selecting an initial random value for parameters and adjusting them iteratively in the direction that reduces error (e.g., adjusting beta values). the formula is:
beta_new = beta_old âˆ’ âˆ‡(ð½)ã—î·
where âˆ‡(ð½) is the gradient and î· is the learning rate.
solvers: solvers are algorithms used to optimize parameter values and minimize model error.

good regression model: a good regression model is indicated by a large f-value, suggesting that the model explains a significant portion of the variance in the data.

model evaluation context:-
model evaluation can be approached in two ways:
between two models: comparing the performance of two models to determine which performs better.
single model evaluation: assessing a single model's performance by analyzing its error metrics (e.g., mean squared error, r-squared, etc.).",statistical significance vs statistical similarity statistically significant indicates observed result unlikely due random chance suggesting effect difference meaningful statistically similar implies significant difference groups compared meaning results likely due random variability rather true effect multiple linear regression mlr embedding vector machine learning text converted vectors allow models process learn textual feature feature engineering understanding creating features essential building effective models involves selecting transforming generating features improve model performance slr simple linear regression vs mlr multiple linear regression unlike simple linear regression mlr closedform solution parameters instead iterative approach estimate parameters gradient descent method minimize error selecting initial random value parameters adjusting iteratively direction reduces error eg adjusting beta values formula betanew betaold âˆ’ âˆ‡ð½ã—î· âˆ‡ð½ gradient î· learning rate solvers solvers algorithms optimize parameter values minimize model error good regression model good regression model indicated large fvalue suggesting model explains significant portion variance model evaluation context model evaluation approached two ways two models comparing performance two models determine performs single model evaluation assessing single models performance analyzing error metrics eg mean squared error rsquared etc,175,15,-11.177019,-8.590166,15,0.72212756,12

mlr continuation:
  here also like slr our objective is to minimize the square of errors. we use matrix terms to simplify the equations and then take the derivative of the cost function. but since mlr may contain different type of errors. mlr is not considered as a closed form. so we cant fix a soln instead we take a random point (random coefficient  values i mean wrt the cost function graph) and use gradient descent to approach the minima after a lot of iterations. same as newton raphson method.

to test this, we worked with a dataset, calculated error metrics, and analyzed different parameters. one key takeaway was that the f-value, unlike r-values, does not have a fixed reference point as to what counts as ""good."" instead, it is better to compare the f-values of two models and say that whatever model has a higher f-value is generally a better model.",first explored algorithms checking assignments work measuring similarity answers gave us insight automated grading systems function next dived multiple linear regression dependent variable influenced multiple independent variables also known features features represented vector x1 x2 xn model follows equation yb0b1x1b2x2bnxn alongside ubiquitous rvalues pvalues also fvalue provides estimate assessing goodness fit model definition fvalue ratio explained unexplained variation greater fvalue model test worked dataset calculated error metrics analyzed different parameters one key takeaway fvalue unlike rvalues fixed reference point counts good instead compare fvalues two models say whatever model higher fvalue generally model,93,15,-9.40005,-0.100732595,15,0.64068365,29

we also looked at how data science algorithms analyze session summaries using a relative strength approach. this method calculates the distance between different submissions based on scatter plot coefficients, helping to evaluate patterns effectively.  

later, we dove into **multiple linear regression**, where a dependent variable is influenced by multiple independent factors. a key concept we explored was the **f-value**, which helps gauge a modelâ€™s effectiveness by comparing explained and unexplained varianceâ€”a higher f-value suggests a better fit. using a dataset, we applied error metrics and compared f-values, getting some hands-on experience in assessing model performance.",built understanding statistical significance shifting gears python assigned tutorials prepare next class also looked science algorithms analyze summaries using relative strength approach method calculates distance different submissions based scatter plot coefficients helping evaluate patterns effectively later dove multiple linear regression dependent variable influenced multiple independent factors key concept explored fvalue helps gauge modelâ€™s effectiveness comparing explained unexplained varianceâ€”a higher fvalue suggests fit using dataset applied error metrics compared fvalues getting handson experience assessing model performance,75,15,-8.4964075,7.6768107,15,0.6334877,31
638,"the class started with a recap of what had been done in the past few classes, specifically doubts regarding p-value. p-values can be used to reject those input variables that don't contribute significant enough to the output. then it was discussed how the summary data that we submit is being analyzed. a similarity heatmap was shown indicating how similar two submissions were. basically, every submission can be considered as a vector in a higher dimensional space. two similar submissions will be close to each other in that space and this idea was used to create that heatmap. this was really amazing to know. it was discussed that even if a student tries to slightly modify another submission, he leaves out trails of it and that can be identified easily using modern ai tools. a little discussion on feature engineering was done. it is making up new features from the existing features to reduce better model the function f. then we started discussing mlr. we discussed that all problems may not have closed form solutions and we use a method called gradient descent to numerically compute the optimal parameters. then it was discussed how quantities like mse, mae, f-score don't give much information about the model and are rather mostly used in comparing two models. finally it was shown how removing those independent variables with higher values of p, lead finally to a model with higher f-score and comparison metric.",class started recap done past classes specifically doubts regarding pvalue pvalues reject input variables dont contribute significant enough output submit analyzed similarity heatmap shown indicating similar two submissions basically every submission considered vector higher dimensional space two similar submissions close space idea create heatmap really amazing know even student tries slightly modify another submission leaves trails identified easily using modern ai tools little feature engineering done making new features existing features reduce model function f started discussing mlr problems may closed form solutions use method called gradient descent numerically compute optimal parameters quantities like mse mae fscore dont give much information model rather mostly comparing two models finally shown removing independent variables higher values p lead finally model higher fscore comparison metric,122,13,1.4701823,-2.1126587,15,0.61917675,32

300,"recap:
emphasis on:
all the values in the ci are not really distinct values

what is the probability of getting d(a value far from the .95 ci)- really small
this is statistically significant

why are we worried about zero
-if beta1 is statistically similar to 0 then we are in trouble -> model not appropriate

if i am getting a non zero value in the ci arund 0 still not good

if i calculate a value if beta1 and it lies in the ci around 0-> still similar to 0
---------
mlr:
so far dealt with one independent variable
mlr- more than 1

relevant examples:
photos- pixels- x1, x2, x3, x4â€¦.
body of text need to be converted to a vector before being processed
â€œembedding vectorâ€
if i want to deal with sales processes- (age, earning, location, family size)- x1,x2, x3â€¦. x_k- features

techniques to select/create features- feature engineering

let us say you want to detect vibrations (x1) which is measured in terms of hertz

we measure the frequency, but it is the rate of change of frequency that we are more interested in

dx1/dt - doesnâ€™t exist as measured value- but we have to calculate it-  this is called feature engineering

in case of slr- we calculated coefficients by minimisation of ei_sq- we had closed form solution
but now we must use numerical solutions for mlr as we dont have a closed form solution for b0 b1 b2â€¦
using...
gradient descent method (it is similar in principle to newton raphson)
â€œn-dimensional hypersurfaceâ€
capturing all equations (yi = b0i + b1ix + â€¦) in a matrix
y = x.b + e -> a very compact notation

e_t.e is divided by 2m for convenience 

the gradient descent process
for all future ml models we learn from now on we wont have a closed form solution, so we will start at a random point

solvers- take an objective function- and try to max or min it
f value- variance by regression/variance by random error
how do we evaluate the value of error metrics like mse, rmse etc- we either do it in the context of its own model or in comparison to another

where are the metrics used-
sse mse- optimisation
rmse mae- interpretation

we need to check if errors are random even after the r^2 values comes out to be good enough

which of the variables are more impactful- which cause more change in the value of y when changed by the same amount

but
check if they are statistically significant- p value- can they be called statistically distinct from 0?

so on the basis of p value we start dropping variables-  â€œfeature selectionâ€
we start at the highest p value and start eliminating until we are satisfied (p value < 0.05)

remember- more the number of variables in consideration- r^2 is bound to increase
